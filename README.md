## Automatic Presentation Generation from Design Documents
Software Requirement Specification (SRS) documents are a useful aid in outlining the goals, specification, requirements and architecture of any large software project. However, it is challenging to  go through the lengthy documents to track the progress each time. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating summaries of SRS documents in the form of presentations. Given the lack of publicly available datasets for SRS documents, we explore the application of transfer learning to customize a pre-trained summarization model, on a small dataset scraped from the web, and manually annotated by human annotators. We indicate the performance of our method on automatic evaluation metrics, such as ROUGE and BERTScore. Further, we also demonstrate the necessity of topical summarization and significance of sectional pre-processing of documents to present the key textual information in a concise format.
