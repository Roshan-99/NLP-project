Introduction 1.1 Purpose DineOut is an android application that aims to digitalize the process of various restaurant management operations including ordering and inventory management and POS. This document aims to capture the system requirements and features particularly related to ordering and inventory management to be implemented in DineOut version 1.0., with the later releases on POS (Point of Sale). 1.2 Document Conventions  1.2.1 Priority Conventions In this complete document, we will mention priority as “low” or “high” throughout the document. Secondly, priorities are only mentioned in section 4 and section 5 along with detailed description of the requirements. Any high-level requirements mentioned elsewhere are assumed to inherit priorities of their detailed counterparts in section 4,5.  1.2.2 Fonts Conventions Throughout this document, All the user entities are written in capitalizations i.e. first letter as capital. Also, any significant term which has been described in the glossary is made bold and italic in the text. On the other hand, those terms which are significant (but not described in glossary) are bold in text. 1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions The purpose of this document is to give a detailed description of the requirements for the “DineOut” software. It will illustrate the purpose, scope and complete description for the development of system. It will also explain external interface requirements and system requirements as well as non-functional requirements. This document is primarily intended to be proposed to a customer for its approval and also for further processing such as additions to be developed in later releases. Customers can refer to section 3 and 4 for the list of requirements implemented in Version 1.0. Users are advised to refer to user documentation section for tutorials and online support information. This document will also be used as a reference for developing and testing Version 1.0 by the development team as well as the testers. The development team can refer to section 2.3 and 2.6 for system level information and section 3 for system features that are to be implemented in this version of the software. Software Requirements Specification for DineOut Page 2 1.4 Product Scope DineOut is a restaurant management system developed with the intention of automating the day to day tasks in a restaurant like order and inventory management, bill generation and taking feedback. This release of the software would deal with these tasks only whereas more areas might be automated in the future versions of this software. The main purpose is to improve the performance of the restaurant by eradicating the daily paperwork. With this system the tasks would be performed in less amount of time and more efficiently. An additional benefit of this software is that during the rush hours the load can be balanced effectively, and restaurants would perform better than usual. In addition to this, human error that occurs when performing tasks manually is also minimized and presence of queues in the system to assign tasks to chefs can reduce congestion in the kitchen. The system would also result in reduction of labor which would result in the reduction of expenses of the restaurant. Feedback module would help the restaurant check for how well they are performing, and monthly/yearly figures can be checked by the billing module to see the trends in sales and profits. These benefits can potentially result in generation of more revenues for the restaurant. 1.5 References 1.

Overall Description This section will give an overview of the DineOut application. The basic functionality of the system as well its context will be explored in detail. It also describes different kinds of stakeholders and user classes associated with the system and what functionality is available for each class. At last, the assumptions and dependencies for the system are presented. 2.1 Product Perspective DineOut app will attempt to replace the traditional manual ordering process and is a new self- contained software system that consists of two parts: one mobile application and the other is Firebase database. The mobile application will be used for ordering and interacting with the inventory while the Firebase database will be used for storing the inventory and ordering related information about the food items like pending and complete order queues. The mobile application will have five interfaces. Each for Customer, Manager, Head Chef, Admin and Chef. Manager can see/edit the status of available/reserved tables. Customer’s interface will consist of a scrollable menu listing available items and their price. When the customer selects some dishes and place the order, it will be stored in “pending orders” table in Firebase database. Head Chef’s interface will be such that he is notified of the pending order and he is able to assign it to one the available queues of chefs who are then able to see the new order in their screens or on a central display in kitchen. After each item/dish in an order is prepared, the order is marked completed through the Head Chef’s interface, the hall manager gets notified through his interface. Customer’s interface has an option for requesting the bill. Bill is printed through the Manager’s interface. Admin can change and modify the Firebase database like add new menus or staff, edit current inventory stock etc. Fig1 - System Perspective Diagram Software Requirements Specification for DineOut Page 4 2.2 Product Functions Given below are the major functions that can be performed using DineOut app. Moreover, a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for better understanding of the system is also given in Appendix B. The system will: • Allow Customers to scroll through the menu and select the dishes he/she wants. • Allow the Customers to cancel/edit the order any time before its prepared. • Allow Customers to provide feedback regarding the food and overall service of the restaurant. • Allow Customers to request for bill. • Allow Customers to ask for help through the system. • Assign Head Chef to assign the dishes in an order to chefs according to their specialties. • Show dish queues and their status, for Chefs. • Allow admin to perform CRUD (create, retrieve, update and delete) operations on Staff Members, Menu Items and Inventory. • Allow Head Chef to mark orders complete. • Allow the Head Chef to approve cancellation of dish or order. • Allow Hall Manager to mark the bill as paid. • Notify the Hall Manager when a particular order is complete. • Allow the Hall Manager to see/edit status of tables reserved and available and their capacities. 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics There are four types of users that interact with our system (See appendix B). Firstly, there is a Hall Manager, then Customer, Head Chef and Admin. We’ll provide an interface for Chefs as well through which they are looking at the status of their order queues, but they will not interact with our system. ',\n",

Introduction 1.1 Purpose DineOut is an android application that aims to digitalize the process of various restaurant management operations including ordering and inventory management and POS. This document aims to capture the system requirements and features particularly related to ordering and inventory management to be implemented in DineOut version 1.0., with the later releases on POS (Point of Sale). 1.2 Document Conventions  1.2.1 Priority Conventions In this complete document, we will mention priority as “low” or “high” throughout the document. Secondly, priorities are only mentioned in section 4 and section 5 along with detailed description of the requirements. Any high-level requirements mentioned elsewhere are assumed to inherit priorities of their detailed counterparts in section 4,5.  1.2.2 Fonts Conventions Throughout this document, All the user entities are written in capitalizations i.e. first letter as capital. Also, any significant term which has been described in the glossary is made bold and italic in the text. On the other hand, those terms which are significant (but not described in glossary) are bold in text. 1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions The purpose of this document is to give a detailed description of the requirements for the “DineOut” software. It will illustrate the purpose, scope and complete description for the development of system. It will also explain external interface requirements and system requirements as well as non-functional requirements. This document is primarily intended to be proposed to a customer for its approval and also for further processing such as additions to be developed in later releases. Customers can refer to section 3 and 4 for the list of requirements implemented in Version 1.0. Users are advised to refer to user documentation section for tutorials and online support information. This document will also be used as a reference for developing and testing Version 1.0 by the development team as well as the testers. The development team can refer to section 2.3 and 2.6 for system level information and section 3 for system features that are to be implemented in this version of the software. Software Requirements Specification for DineOut Page 2 1.4 Product Scope DineOut is a restaurant management system developed with the intention of automating the day to day tasks in a restaurant like order and inventory management, bill generation and taking feedback. This release of the software would deal with these tasks only whereas more areas might be automated in the future versions of this software. The main purpose is to improve the performance of the restaurant by eradicating the daily paperwork. With this system the tasks would be performed in less amount of time and more efficiently. An additional benefit of this software is that during the rush hours the load can be balanced effectively, and restaurants would perform better than usual. In addition to this, human error that occurs when performing tasks manually is also minimized and presence of queues in the system to assign tasks to chefs can reduce congestion in the kitchen. The system would also result in reduction of labor which would result in the reduction of expenses of the restaurant. Feedback module would help the restaurant check for how well they are performing, and monthly/yearly figures can be checked by the billing module to see the trends in sales and profits. These benefits can potentially result in generation of more revenues for the restaurant. 1.5 References 1.

Overall Description This section will give an overview of the DineOut application. The basic functionality of the system as well its context will be explored in detail. It also describes different kinds of stakeholders and user classes associated with the system and what functionality is available for each class. At last, the assumptions and dependencies for the system are presented. 2.1 Product Perspective DineOut app will attempt to replace the traditional manual ordering process and is a new self- contained software system that consists of two parts: one mobile application and the other is Firebase database. The mobile application will be used for ordering and interacting with the inventory while the Firebase database will be used for storing the inventory and ordering related information about the food items like pending and complete order queues. The mobile application will have five interfaces. Each for Customer, Manager, Head Chef, Admin and Chef. Manager can see/edit the status of available/reserved tables. Customer’s interface will consist of a scrollable menu listing available items and their price. When the customer selects some dishes and place the order, it will be stored in “pending orders” table in Firebase database. Head Chef’s interface will be such that he is notified of the pending order and he is able to assign it to one the available queues of chefs who are then able to see the new order in their screens or on a central display in kitchen. After each item/dish in an order is prepared, the order is marked completed through the Head Chef’s interface, the hall manager gets notified through his interface. Customer’s interface has an option for requesting the bill. Bill is printed through the Manager’s interface. Admin can change and modify the Firebase database like add new menus or staff, edit current inventory stock etc. Fig1 - System Perspective Diagram Software Requirements Specification for DineOut Page 4 2.2 Product Functions Given below are the major functions that can be performed using DineOut app. Moreover, a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for better understanding of the system is also given in Appendix B. The system will: • Allow Customers to scroll through the menu and select the dishes he/she wants. • Allow the Customers to cancel/edit the order any time before its prepared. • Allow Customers to provide feedback regarding the food and overall service of the restaurant. • Allow Customers to request for bill. • Allow Customers to ask for help through the system. • Assign Head Chef to assign the dishes in an order to chefs according to their specialties. • Show dish queues and their status, for Chefs. • Allow admin to perform CRUD (create, retrieve, update and delete) operations on Staff Members, Menu Items and Inventory. • Allow Head Chef to mark orders complete. • Allow the Head Chef to approve cancellation of dish or order. • Allow Hall Manager to mark the bill as paid. • Notify the Hall Manager when a particular order is complete. • Allow the Hall Manager to see/edit status of tables reserved and available and their capacities. 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics There are four types of users that interact with our system (See appendix B). Firstly, there is a Hall Manager, then Customer, Head Chef and Admin. We’ll provide an interface for Chefs as well through which they are looking at the status of their order queues, but they will not interact with our system. '},\n",

The system would also result in reduction of labor which would result in the reduction of expenses of the restaurant. Feedback module would help the restaurant check for how well they are performing, and monthly/yearly figures can be checked by the billing module to see the trends in sales and profits. These benefits can potentially result in generation of more revenues for the restaurant. 1.5 References 1.

Overall Description This section will give an overview of the DineOut application. The basic functionality of the system as well its context will be explored in detail. It also describes different kinds of stakeholders and user classes associated with the system and what functionality is available for each class. At last, the assumptions and dependencies for the system are presented. 2.1 Product Perspective DineOut app will attempt to replace the traditional manual ordering process and is a new self- contained software system that consists of two parts: one mobile application and the other is Firebase database. The mobile application will be used for ordering and interacting with the inventory while the Firebase database will be used for storing the inventory and ordering related information about the food items like pending and complete order queues. The mobile application will have five interfaces. Each for Customer, Manager, Head Chef, Admin and Chef. Manager can see/edit the status of available/reserved tables. Customer’s interface will consist of a scrollable menu listing available items and their price. When the customer selects some dishes and place the order, it will be stored in “pending orders” table in Firebase database. Head Chef’s interface will be such that he is notified of the pending order and he is able to assign it to one the available queues of chefs who are then able to see the new order in their screens or on a central display in kitchen. After each item/dish in an order is prepared, the order is marked completed through the Head Chef’s interface, the hall manager gets notified through his interface. Customer’s interface has an option for requesting the bill. Bill is printed through the Manager’s interface. Admin can change and modify the Firebase database like add new menus or staff, edit current inventory stock etc. Fig1 - System Perspective Diagram Software Requirements Specification for DineOut Page 4 2.2 Product Functions Given below are the major functions that can be performed using DineOut app. Moreover, a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for better understanding of the system is also given in Appendix B. The system will: • Allow Customers to scroll through the menu and select the dishes he/she wants. • Allow the Customers to cancel/edit the order any time before its prepared. • Allow Customers to provide feedback regarding the food and overall service of the restaurant. • Allow Customers to request for bill. • Allow Customers to ask for help through the system. • Assign Head Chef to assign the dishes in an order to chefs according to their specialties. • Show dish queues and their status, for Chefs. • Allow admin to perform CRUD (create, retrieve, update and delete) operations on Staff Members, Menu Items and Inventory. • Allow Head Chef to mark orders complete. • Allow the Head Chef to approve cancellation of dish or order. • Allow Hall Manager to mark the bill as paid. • Notify the Hall Manager when a particular order is complete. • Allow the Hall Manager to see/edit status of tables reserved and available and their capacities. 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics There are four types of users that interact with our system (See appendix B). Firstly, there is a Hall Manager, then Customer, Head Chef and Admin. We’ll provide an interface for Chefs as well through which they are looking at the status of their order queues, but they will not interact with our system.  2.3.1 Customer Class Customers interact with our system directly in order to place order, modify order, get bill and give feedback. We do not store any information related to customers in our system. The process of order taking starts from customers placing order and then the other series of events begin. '}},\n",

This Software Requirements Specification illustrates, in clear terms, the system’s primary uses and required functionality as specified by our customer. The intended audience of this document is our primary Book E-Commerce System customer: Mr. Borzoo Bonakdarpour, the CSE435 instructor Dr. Betty Cheng, the fall semester 2007 CSE435 Group 4 members, as well as the other students attending CSE435 that will require access to such documentation. Template based on IEEE Std 830-1998 for SRS. Modifications (content and ordering of information) have been made by Betty H.C. Cheng, Michigan State University (chengb at chengb.cse.msu.edu) 1.2 Scope  The software system being produced is called Book E-Commerce System or BECS. It is being produced for a customer interested in selling books via the Internet. This system is designed to “provide automation support” [2] for the process of placing books for sale on the Internet and facilitating the actual sale. This system is largely cross-platform and is available to anyone using the Computer Science Department’s provided computer resources in the MSU Engineering Building. The system will be run on a central server with each user having a remote user interface through a web browser to interact with it. The Book E-Commerce System will allow any user to create an account to become a customer. The customer, through the process of account creation, will have the option to become a member of the site. The system will allow customers to browse, search, select, and add books to a shopping cart. Then, provided they have books in their shopping cart, check out books in shopping cart and decrement the stock that the inventory the system maintains. The BECS also allows a manager to manage the inventory with full create, retrieve, update and delete (CRUD) functionality with regards to books in the system. It will also allow, on an inventory wide basis, customers and managers to interact with a promotion system that handles percentage-off promotions that can be applied to member’s orders. This interaction includes the creation (by managers) and the application to orders (by customers) of the promotions. The BECS has full email capabilities; the automated email functionality will be used to send promotions to members of the system as well as provide the managers with low-stock notifications. The BECS will have numerous constraints on what it can do. The system will not have full credit-card processing capabilities. It will not allow managers to be customers. The manager will be a hard-coded user and only a single manager will exist. There will be no actual book ordering and order completion, however the system will provide the customer with a receipt and it will log the transaction details. The system will not allow multiple promotions to be added to a single shopping cart nor will it allow a customer to add more than one of each item to their cart. The system also will not allow users to retrieve passwords or edit their user details. 1.3 Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations BECS  Book E-Commerce System Barcode ',\n",

Throughout the description of the software system, the language and terminology used should unambiguous and consistent throughout the document. 1.1 Purpose  Defining and describing the functions and specifications of the Book E-Commerce System (BECS) is the primary goal of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS). This Software Requirements Specification illustrates, in clear terms, the system’s primary uses and required functionality as specified by our customer. The intended audience of this document is our primary Book E-Commerce System customer: Mr. Borzoo Bonakdarpour, the CSE435 instructor Dr. Betty Cheng, the fall semester 2007 CSE435 Group 4 members, as well as the other students attending CSE435 that will require access to such documentation. Template based on IEEE Std 830-1998 for SRS. Modifications (content and ordering of information) have been made by Betty H.C. Cheng, Michigan State University (chengb at chengb.cse.msu.edu) 1.2 Scope  The software system being produced is called Book E-Commerce System or BECS. It is being produced for a customer interested in selling books via the Internet. This system is designed to “provide automation support” [2] for the process of placing books for sale on the Internet and facilitating the actual sale. This system is largely cross-platform and is available to anyone using the Computer Science Department’s provided computer resources in the MSU Engineering Building. The system will be run on a central server with each user having a remote user interface through a web browser to interact with it. The Book E-Commerce System will allow any user to create an account to become a customer. The customer, through the process of account creation, will have the option to become a member of the site. The system will allow customers to browse, search, select, and add books to a shopping cart. Then, provided they have books in their shopping cart, check out books in shopping cart and decrement the stock that the inventory the system maintains. The BECS also allows a manager to manage the inventory with full create, retrieve, update and delete (CRUD) functionality with regards to books in the system. It will also allow, on an inventory wide basis, customers and managers to interact with a promotion system that handles percentage-off promotions that can be applied to member’s orders. This interaction includes the creation (by managers) and the application to orders (by customers) of the promotions. The BECS has full email capabilities; the automated email functionality will be used to send promotions to members of the system as well as provide the managers with low-stock notifications. The BECS will have numerous constraints on what it can do. The system will not have full credit-card processing capabilities. It will not allow managers to be customers. The manager will be a hard-coded user and only a single manager will exist. There will be no actual book ordering and order completion, however the system will provide the customer with a receipt and it will log the transaction details. The system will not allow multiple promotions to be added to a single shopping cart nor will it allow a customer to add more than one of each item to their cart. The system also will not allow users to retrieve passwords or edit their user details. 1.3 Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations BECS '},\n",

The database may store passwords in plain text and there doesn\\'t need to be a password recovery feature nor lockout after numerous invalid login attempts. As such, the system may not work correctly in cases when security is a concern. These cases include those listed above in addition to lack of an encrypted connection when sending credit card information and forcing users to use “strong” passwords. A strong password is a password that meets a number of conditions that are set in place so that user\\'s passwords cannot be easily guessed by an attacker. Generally, these rules include ensuring that the password contains a sufficient number of characters and contains not only lowercase letters but also capitals, numbers, and in some cases, symbols.

       "  'What are the requirements functional non functional': {1: 'The testing of a software product should include four components. These are 1. Functional coverage, 2. Topological coverage, 3. Component interface, 4. Performance measures. Functional coverage refers to how many of the code processes and data (if applicable) are exercised during the testing. An example of a process is the editing and retrieval features built into the Document Database. Data refers to the pieces of information stored, retrieved, and manipulated by the software. Topological coverage refers to the logic path that the code takes to determines if a particular function, task, or feature is executed. For example, the logic path the code may take to allow record retrieval may involve first checking the user identification and then checking if the record exists. Component interface refers to how well each of the code components or modules work together as a whole. Each module or component may work fine independently. Testing the component interface verifies that the code logic linking each component operates correctly. Performance measures refer to measures that quantitatively describe how well the code performed during testing. In this test plan, we have attempted to address all four of these components by designating a test database that will include entries in all data entities and data fields, and testing all code features that have been written and implemented. Neither functional or topological coverage is 100% assured, but through the methods outlined in this test plan, we can be reasonably assured that most situations a user may encounter during normal operation of the code are tested.

Evaluation of Materials Released from SRS Software Quality Assurance I2-3 FEATURES TO BE TESTED  User interface application modules are written under the Visual Foxpro object-oriented programming language. The user is presented a series of menu items that perform specific tasks. These items have methods and properties attached to them and it is these features that will be tested, along with the relational integrity of the data tables that are linked to their operation. A main menu is presented first and includes the items typically found on most Windows -based applications. Under each main menu item is a series of submenus that exercises different options, depending on the needs of the user. The main menu items shown in Figure I2-1 will be tested. The referential integrity of each table will also be tested as stated in the software requirements and design specifications document ( Rood et al. 1996 ). APPROACH ',\n",

The database tracks • Published internal documents and reports, • Journal articles and books, • Unpublished reports, memos, and letters, • Field or office notebooks and log entries, • Laboratory analysis reports and associated quality assurance documentation, • Databases, electronic or otherwise, containing information used in the study (e.g. monitoring data), • Documented information and data obtained from interviews or phone conversations, and • other documented information. QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS  Software design, development, testing, and implementation is subject to the quality assurance (QA) requirements stated in Task 6 of the RAC Technical Proposal. These include the following: 1. A software requirements specification document, 2. A software design document, 3. A software test plan (verification and validation test plan), 4. Verification and validation test results and, 5. Software user’s manual. This document provides the software requirements and design specifications. All database requirements as specified in the contract will be me via a program of review and comparison carried out by at least two RAC reviewers. In addition, at least two RAC reviewers, and the CDC and external reviewers, will examine the database to ensure that: 1) test data, audio files and other nonessential elements are removed from the database before delivery to CDC; 2) all citations in  Risk Assessment Corporation “Setting the standard in environmental health” ',\n",
       "   5: 'This test plan covers the testing of the Document Database software by independent reviewers. The developers may also use the procedures defined in this document for internal testing before release. The testing will cover referential integrity of the tables and the application software designed to manage and control input, output, and editing of the tables. TEST ITEMS  The testing of a software product should include four components. These are 1. Functional coverage, 2. Topological coverage, 3. Component interface, 4. Performance measures. Functional coverage refers to how many of the code processes and data (if applicable) are exercised during the testing. An example of a process is the editing and retrieval features built into the Document Database. Data refers to the pieces of information stored, retrieved, and manipulated by the software. Topological coverage refers to the logic path that the code takes to determines if a particular function, task, or feature is executed. For example, the logic path the code may take to allow record retrieval may involve first checking the user identification and then checking if the record exists. Component interface refers to how well each of the code components or modules work together as a whole. Each module or component may work fine independently. Testing the component interface verifies that the code logic linking each component operates correctly. Performance measures refer to measures that quantitatively describe how well the code performed during testing. In this test plan, we have attempted to address all four of these components by designating a test database that will include entries in all data entities and data fields, and testing all code features that have been written and implemented. Neither functional or topological coverage is 100% assured, but through the methods outlined in this test plan, we can be reasonably assured that most situations a user may encounter during normal operation of the code are tested. The software tested will be designated the Beta Test Version until successful completion of the testing procedures.

       "  'Who are the users or audience': {1: 'RAC RAC reports are correctly listed in the database; 3) cross references between RAC reports and source documents are correct; and 4) source document authors are listed correctly. HOST SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS  The document database software will use the Foxpro \\uf8e9 relational database language and will require a microcomputer operating under MS DOS \\uf8e9 , Version 6.0 or higher, Windows \\uf8e9 Version 3.1 or higher, and at least 8MB of extended random access memory, although 16MB is preferable. About 200MB of free hard disk space will be required to load and operate the software. GENERAL USER INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS  The software will provide a user interface to allow a trained nondeveloper to add, subtract, edit, or query fields in the database. The user interface will be written in the Visual Foxpro programming language. The user will be presented with a typical Windows based interface menu. Under each main menu item, the user will be able to select options such as data entry and report generation. The current menu options are shown in Figure I1-1 . Typically, opening, closing, saving, and exiting a Windows application is accomplished through the file menu option. However, this software does not include open, close, and save menu options because the database files will automatically be opened or saved when opening or exiting the application. The Edit menu contains the typical Windows options such as Cut , Copy , Paste , and Select . The core of the application is the Data Entry menu ( Figure I1-1 ). The user may search for records and view their contents, add records, delete records, and print selected records. Records can be retrieved, added, deleted, edited, or printed. There are four areas of data entry: 1. Those that refer to SRS Environmental Dose Reconstruction discovery documents ( Documents ), 2. Those that contain information of persons involved in the dose reconstruction ( Personnel ), 3. Those that describe documents created for Phase II of the SRS Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project ( Project Reports ), and 4. Those that describe interviews that have been conducted ( Interviews ). Printed reports can be obtained from the Reports menu. Reports may be printed for all the categories listed under the Data Entry menu. The Utilities menu offers options to export data to other databases via the DBS format, or export the data for use in a Geographical Information System (GIS). The Utilities menu also allows access to tables so the lookup table can be updated throughout the life of the project. ',\n",

DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS  The software will use the Visual Foxpro relational database software and programming language. Foxpro databases (designated with the .DBC extension) are composed of tables that are designated with a .DBF file extension. Tables will be created for each data entity . Each entity may contain numerous data fields . A field contains the information that is either entered or retrieved by the user, or defined based on a logical expression. A field is designated as a character field, numeric field, date field, logical field, or memo field. Character, date, memo, and numeric fields have lengths defined by the developer. That is, the field has a limited number of characters that may be entered in the field by the end-user. Logical fields have a predefined length of 1. Tables are usually linked to other tables by fields of the same name and data type and length. In this way, the information presented to the end-user may originate from several tables that are related by fields of the same type and length. The user interface will access the tables to enter data, edit existing data, query existing data, and generate reports. The program will be compiled into an executable file for distribution to end- users. ',\n",

It specifies user interface attributes, functional and nonfunctional requirements, and long- term ideas for the evolution of the system. 2.2 Overview  Climate Central performs scientific research to collect multi-coordinate data on climate change. The company creates interactive maps and other graphics to present this data on their website for public consumption. For example, one such demonstration colors each state in the United States based on its recorded change in temperature. Clicking on a state displays a line graph showing the temperature data for that particular state. Currently, Climate Central develops each interactive visualization from scratch. This process is time and labor intensive and does not provide any mechanism for reusing common elements across visualizations. ',\n",
       "   5: \"44 6. System Evolution  To narrow the scope of initial development, the current requirements are based on two expectations. The first expectation is that only a few widgets are needed to support Climate Central's immediate use cases. The second expectation is that WAVED is not public facing, but rather a tool used on an internal network, so an open permissions model suffices. As the system evolves, changes to WAVED adds functionality beyond these assumptions. 6.1 New Widgets  Future modifications to the system include expanding the set of available widgets by implementing new plugins.

Purpose The present Nodes Portal Toolkit (NPT) Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document was prepared as the next incremental step after the NPT Scoping and Requirements (S&R) document , which was drafted by the NPT Advisory Group (AG), during the Madrid workshop in March 2011 and publicly released in June 2011. The purpose of the SRS is to describe the software requirements for the NPT, reaching a level of detail which makes it fit to be circulated amongst the NPT stakeholders, and in particular amongst the NPT developers. It is also intended to serve as a basis for discussion during the Brussels NPT technical meeting (September 2011), during which elements for a high-level architectural and design document will be gathered. The purpose of the current version of the SRS document is to clarify, validate and verify the requirements for the NPT as expressed by the NPT-AG, focusing on its functional aspects. The SRS captures and describes the desired behavior of the end product in a wide range of situations. Some of the non-functional requirements in this document were taken as is from the scoping document and can still be refined. The present document is also intended to be a planning instrument for the The present document is also intended to be a planning instrument for the development of the NPT and its potential derivatives. Scope of the NPT As described in the NPT (S&R) document , the Nodes Portal Toolkit is a tool to facilitate discovery and access to GBIF data at a national, regional or thematic level, including the possibility to offer access to additional sources of information. The primary users of the NPT are the Node Managers (specifically, the technical teams involved in GBIF Participant Nodes and/or relevant biodiversity information networks), as well as the End-Users of the data published through the various NPT instances. The NPT should enable the Node Managers to customize the way GBIF-compliant data are served to their own community or to a specific group of data users. Development of the NPT is based on the needs expressed by the Nodes community. To the best extent possible, the wishes of the Nodes and their communities regarding NPT functionalities will be expressed in the flexibility and scalability of the tool itself. Commitment and feedback is expected from the Nodes community in order to align their needs and the functionalities of the NPT, as it evolves in its various releases. Even if the NPT is intended to be a technical tool, NPT-based portals are also envisioned as an important public relations and communication tool for GBIF Participant Nodes, serving also to demonstrate the possibilities that the GBIF network offers at different levels (national, regional, thematic). 7 Product perspective and historical background The need for GBIF Participant Node data portals distinct from (and interacting with) the GBIF central portal was already recognized at the first meeting of the Nodes committee in Oct 2002 in San Juan, Costa Rica as a major component of the overall GBIF architecture. This quickly led to the release of a first version of a GBIF Portal toolkit for Nodes (Dec 2002). As there were still no GBIF-mediated data to share at that time, this early portal was mainly a communication tool (featuring a hierarchical directory of links, files and html pages, announcements, news and articles, calendar of events, news channels syndication, etc.…). It also featured a repository for biodiversity data files exported from databases (prefiguring to some degree the approach adopted by the current IPT software in which exported Darwin Core Archives are used to facilitate indexing). Nodes started to deploy the GBIF DiGIR network to publish species occurrence data in the fall of 2004 (BioCASE sites following shortly after). A first prototype GBIF central portal was officially launched in February 2004. In April 2004, Nodes recommended to consider the development of a data portal toolkit for nodes as part of a work program. In October 2004, the recommendation became a ranked priority, second only to hiring a full time Nodes officer. Between May and October 2005, a draft requirements document was developed, a workshop was held in Copenhagen and some resources were allocated to an early prototype presented in April 2006 in South Africa. At that time, the customized portal for nodes was pretty much perceived as a national or thematic subset of the central portal. Subsequently the secretariat focused on the development of a new central portal and the prototype custom portal for nodes was never deployed. In the summer of 2009, an online survey was conducted with preliminary results presented at the Nodes meeting in Copenhagen in October. This led to convening an Advisory Group (AG) in December 2009 in Montreal to work on a scoping document for a Nodes Portal Toolkit (NPT) and a set of recommendations on how to develop, implement and deploy such a toolkit. The AG met again in March 2011 in Madrid and prepared the scoping (S&R) document, under the supervision of the NPT Coordinator. After revision and consultation loops between the NPT AG, the GBIF secretariat and the NPT-Coordinator, the S&R document was publicly released in June 2011. Document conventions The main type of convention used throughout this document helps to represent the level of priority of the different software requirements. These priorities are established in function of many factors, including those identified in the NPT (S&R) document , consultation loops with the NPT stakeholders, and technical constraints which represent the reality at the moment this document is prepared. In the functional requirements section, to keep consistency with the NPT (S&R) document , the same color codes define priorities as defined by the MoSCoW method . Green: NPT V1.0 must have this feature Green: NPT V1.0 must have this feature Yellow: NPT V1.0 should have this feature if at all possible Red: NPT V1.0 could have this feature (if it doesn't affect anything else) Black: NPT V1.0 won't have this feature (maybe in the future) 8 In Use Case surveys , and Use Case sections, priorities and frequency are attributed an increasing index, ranging from 1 (low priority/frequency) to 5 (high priority/frequency). In the nonfunctional requirements section , a series of acronyms are used, as described below: BR = Business Rules CO = Design and Implementation Constraints CR = Capacity Requirements IR = Interoperability Requirements OE = Operating Environment RR = Robustness Requirements ScaR = Scalability Requirements SR = Security Requirements SupR = Supportability Requirements UD = User Documentation UR = Usability Requirements 9 Actor Survey This section lists the different actors NPT instances shall interact with: end users (primary actors) and actors from which the system needs assistance to satisfy a goal (secondary actors).

       "   3: \"6 Introduction The NPT is a community, open source project. Purpose The present Nodes Portal Toolkit (NPT) Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document was prepared as the next incremental step after the NPT Scoping and Requirements (S&R) document , which was drafted by the NPT Advisory Group (AG), during the Madrid workshop in March 2011 and publicly released in June 2011. The purpose of the SRS is to describe the software requirements for the NPT, reaching a level of detail which makes it fit to be circulated amongst the NPT stakeholders, and in particular amongst the NPT developers. It is also intended to serve as a basis for discussion during the Brussels NPT technical meeting (September 2011), during which elements for a high-level architectural and design document will be gathered. The purpose of the current version of the SRS document is to clarify, validate and verify the requirements for the NPT as expressed by the NPT-AG, focusing on its functional aspects. The SRS captures and describes the desired behavior of the end product in a wide range of situations. Some of the non-functional requirements in this document were taken as is from the scoping document and can still be refined. The present document is also intended to be a planning instrument for the The present document is also intended to be a planning instrument for the development of the NPT and its potential derivatives. Scope of the NPT As described in the NPT (S&R) document , the Nodes Portal Toolkit is a tool to facilitate discovery and access to GBIF data at a national, regional or thematic level, including the possibility to offer access to additional sources of information. The primary users of the NPT are the Node Managers (specifically, the technical teams involved in GBIF Participant Nodes and/or relevant biodiversity information networks), as well as the End-Users of the data published through the various NPT instances. The NPT should enable the Node Managers to customize the way GBIF-compliant data are served to their own community or to a specific group of data users. Development of the NPT is based on the needs expressed by the Nodes community. To the best extent possible, the wishes of the Nodes and their communities regarding NPT functionalities will be expressed in the flexibility and scalability of the tool itself. Commitment and feedback is expected from the Nodes community in order to align their needs and the functionalities of the NPT, as it evolves in its various releases. Even if the NPT is intended to be a technical tool, NPT-based portals are also envisioned as an important public relations and communication tool for GBIF Participant Nodes, serving also to demonstrate the possibilities that the GBIF network offers at different levels (national, regional, thematic). 7 Product perspective and historical background The need for GBIF Participant Node data portals distinct from (and interacting with) the GBIF central portal was already recognized at the first meeting of the Nodes committee in Oct 2002 in San Juan, Costa Rica as a major component of the overall GBIF architecture. This quickly led to the release of a first version of a GBIF Portal toolkit for Nodes (Dec 2002). As there were still no GBIF-mediated data to share at that time, this early portal was mainly a communication tool (featuring a hierarchical directory of links, files and html pages, announcements, news and articles, calendar of events, news channels syndication, etc.…). It also featured a repository for biodiversity data files exported from databases (prefiguring to some degree the approach adopted by the current IPT software in which exported Darwin Core Archives are used to facilitate indexing). Nodes started to deploy the GBIF DiGIR network to publish species occurrence data in the fall of 2004 (BioCASE sites following shortly after). A first prototype GBIF central portal was officially launched in February 2004. In April 2004, Nodes recommended to consider the development of a data portal toolkit for nodes as part of a work program. In October 2004, the recommendation became a ranked priority, second only to hiring a full time Nodes officer. Between May and October 2005, a draft requirements document was developed, a workshop was held in Copenhagen and some resources were allocated to an early prototype presented in April 2006 in South Africa. At that time, the customized portal for nodes was pretty much perceived as a national or thematic subset of the central portal. Subsequently the secretariat focused on the development of a new central portal and the prototype custom portal for nodes was never deployed. In the summer of 2009, an online survey was conducted with preliminary results presented at the Nodes meeting in Copenhagen in October. This led to convening an Advisory Group (AG) in December 2009 in Montreal to work on a scoping document for a Nodes Portal Toolkit (NPT) and a set of recommendations on how to develop, implement and deploy such a toolkit. The AG met again in March 2011 in Madrid and prepared the scoping (S&R) document, under the supervision of the NPT Coordinator. After revision and consultation loops between the NPT AG, the GBIF secretariat and the NPT-Coordinator, the S&R document was publicly released in June 2011. Document conventions The main type of convention used throughout this document helps to represent the level of priority of the different software requirements. These priorities are established in function of many factors, including those identified in the NPT (S&R) document , consultation loops with the NPT stakeholders, and technical constraints which represent the reality at the moment this document is prepared. In the functional requirements section, to keep consistency with the NPT (S&R) document , the same color codes define priorities as defined by the MoSCoW method .

In the meeting with our customer we discussed changing lanes as a feature beyond the scope of this project. Another point of interest discussed with the customer is that the car will not pull over to the side of the road when the driver is not paying attention. Rather, the HFDS comes to a complete stop in the same lane of the vehicle when the HFDS is activated. Also, using this system on roads other than highways is beyond the scope of this project.

Cheng, Michigan State University 1 Introduction  The Hands-Free Driving System is an embedded software system inside a vehicle that controls the tasks the user would normally handle such as steering the vehicle, accelerating and braking the vehicle. The Hands-Free Driving System (HFDS) description of requirements is split between the following sections, Overall Description, Specific Requirements, Modeling Requirements, and Prototype. The overall description describes information regarding constraints of the user, system, software and hardware as well as how the system will be used in context of Hands-Free Driving. The specific requirements for the HFDS list what is and is not possible for the system to achieve as well as some cybersecurity requirements for the system. The modeling requirements are a low level display of how the system conveys the requirements. The prototype demonstrates the system in action. 1.1 Purpose '},\n",

       "   4: 'Figure 1: Diagram of the high-level goals of the HFDS 2.2 Product Functions  There are many subsystems for the HFDS which need descriptions to understand the system as a whole. One function of the system is called the Driver Assist Subsystem and it grabs data necessary to determine safe conditions. Also it calculates vehicle position, and trajectory ensuring safe following distance. The Driver Attention Subsystem monitors the eye and head movement of the driver to decide whether or not they are paying attention and warns inattentive drivers. The Vehicle Control System uses the driver assist data to decide whether to turn, brake, or accelerate. Human Machine Interface Subsystem is another subsystem that uses data from other systems to display warnings or issues with the system. Path Prediction Subsystem is a system that uses LiDAR, and GPS mapping to create a path for the vehicle to proceed. The last system is the Vehicle Position System which reads information from exterior cameras to give the hands-free driving system the vehicles real world position. 2.3 User Characteristics  There are a few expectations of the user to operate the system. The user is expected to be capable of operating a vehicle and operates the vehicle legally. The user is expected to have knowledge of the Hands-Free Driving and how to use it. 2.4 Constraints ',\n",

Shneiderman et al. (2016) suggested that in a user- centered design technique, user behavior research should be undertaken by studying his or her working environment (i.e., workplace and task list). Authors use the agile usage-centered design method  ( Valacich and George, 2019 ; Patton, 2002 ; 2004 ; Constantine and Lockwood, 2002 ) in order to develop the suggested application.

The use case diagram of the IMMITN application consists of four actors, and seven use cases. It is not enough just to show the use case diagram in UML notation. A detailed explanation must be provided for each use- case. A detailed tabular presentation of each use- case is presented by use-case description. The use case is a description of one kind of interaction between a user and a software system. The use case ',\n",

Thus, the use case description assists software designers to recognize objects and processes in the software system. This gives designers a comprehension of what the software is planned to make ( Sommerville, 2016 ). The use case description consists of a graphical notation and structured natural language text ( Table 3 ).  The sequence diagram shows the sequence of  interactions between users and the software and between software objects or screens ( Sommerville, 2016 ; Valacich and George, 2019 ). The sequence diagram displays what inputs are needed and what outputs are produced for one type of interaction between user and software system.

In the context of shares, it is buying/selling a group of shares of the same company, and in context of Bank it is deposit/withdrawal of money to/from one’s account. b. Security: A set of all transactions pertaining to a company share or a bank account. c. Portfolio: A set of Securities. d. Net-Worth: The sum total of all the money of the investor in form of shares and bank balances. e. ROI: The interest that user gets on a particular investment. In the context of a bank account it is the annual interest and in case of a company share it is defined as given in appendix A: 1.4 References: Appendix A: Formula for ROI calculation for shares. Appendix B: Formula for Net-Worth calculation. Appendix C: User Screens. 1.5 Overview: The rest of this SRS is organized as follows: Section 2 gives an overall description of the software. It gives what level of proficiency is expected of the user, some general constraints while making the software and some assumptions and dependencies that are assumed. Section 3 gives specific requirements which the software is expected to deliver. Functional requirements are given by various use cases. Some performance requirements and design constraints are also given. Section 4 gives some possible future extensions of the system. Finally the appendices in Section 5 describe respectively the formula for ROI calculation for shares and user screen. 2. Overall Description: 2.1 Product Perspective: PIMS is aimed toward a person who has considerable number of investments in stock market and banks, and so needs software assistance for book keeping and computations regarding the investments. PIMS should be user-friendly, ‘quick to learn’ and reliable software for the above purpose. PIMS is intended to be a stand-alone product and should not depend on the availability of other software. It should run on both UNIX and Windows based platform. 2.2 Product Functions: PIMS should support the following use cases: 3 ',\n",

Introduction  The MIP aims to enable breakthrough medical progress in the field of brain diseases through federated analysis of data residing in a wide network of hospitals.  More precisely, the goal for the MIP in SGA2 is to capture clinical data from more than 30,000 patients with brain diseases. Most of the data to be incorporated within the MIP will be provided by a few large, existing patient cohorts, via signed partnerships (e.g. CREACTIVE will provide 5,000 patients with TBI, while WP8.10 will provide cohorts of several thousand patients with psychiatric disorders). Other hospitals will contribute smaller cohorts, of around 1,000 patients. '},\n",

       "   4: 'For developing the project, we have planned to use Scrum which is an agile software  development methodology. Scrum is incremental and iterative. In scrum, main work is divided into sprints which should be completed within a certain period of time which could be 30 days on average. Iteration length of every sprint must be equal, because scrum is an agile development methodology. Every Sprint includes tasks which has own story points and risk points. Development team should have a daily meeting every morning which should be maximum 15 minutes. Scrum has three main roles which are product owner, scrum master and development team. Product owner is the person who delivers the requirements, scrum master is the person who manages the development team. Development team is the group of developers who work on the project according to schedule. There are some advantages of Scrum. First advantage is that it is easier to cope with changes because of short sprints and constant feedback. Another advantage is problems can be handled swiftly due to morning meetings. Also, it makes it possible to create quality products in scheduled time [1]. Figure 1 represents four sprints of the project on the lab board. Sprint is one of the most important feature for Scrum methodology. At the end of each sprint, a part of project has been completed and it has been presented to customer for validation. By taking into consideration of these facts, Scrum is the most suitable methodology for the project. 6  Figure 1 All Sprints of the Project on the Board ',\n",

Since his graduation 12 years ago he has been working on 2 other companies before ImagniCorp, and he is currently starting his 8th year at ImagniCorp. During his time at his current employee he has had a variety of different positions in the company. He started out as a Requirements Engineer and after a while he went in to development before going on to the testing and verification team. As a result of hard work and good reputation among his co- workers he was appointed Project Manager of his first project in 2009 and has been working as a Project Manager since that year. Due to the fact that he possesses a very good basis as a result of working in different departments of the software process he has made a great Project Manager and is known for delivering high quality projects fairly on budget and time. Mr. Johansson and his wife since 5 years, Kate Johansson, have three children named Tim, John and Anna. Both Mr. and Mrs. Johansson are very interested in sports and are both competitive people. Mr. Johansson has a big interest in new technology and through his education and professional experience he has gained a deep knowledge about software system and implementation processes. The knowledge that Mr. Johansson possesses is a good estimation for the average knowledge between the Requirements Engineers and the Developers at ImagniCorp. 4 Copyright © the Atlantic Systems Guild Limited Volere Template V15 /4 2h.

CACC++ enables a vehicle to follow a platoon with the use of sensors to detect nearby vehicles and follow safety procedures, while maintaining a constant speed and distance set by the driver. To achieve an advanced system, key points such as functionality, requirements, constraints, and dependencies highlight the importance of the necessary details in the CACC++ system. Models are included to provide more detailed interpretations, as well as a prototype that demonstrates several scenarios in which the system behaves. The CACC++ system contains subsystems that include sensors, communication, and control of the vehicle to function without the dependency of an operator. 1.1 Purpose A functional CACC++ relies on its underlying subsystems and allows the interaction between infrastructure and the vehicle with the appropriate actions to such scenarios. The purpose of the software requirements specification is to help the customer understand the team’s interpretation of the product and their approach on how to achieve a system that follows the requirements. Several diagrams are provided that describe the CACC++ system in detail and how it is used daily to provide a better understanding for the reader. A domain model is included, which maps out the main components of the system. A use case diagram is also added, which models common high level behaviors of the system. Sequence diagrams, which describe the interactions between the classes in the domain model in different scenarios are also included. And lastly, state diagrams are included which describe how components of our system move through different states and respond to outside messages. 1.2 Scope CACC++ is a system available in a vehicle that allows the driver to let the vehicle operate independently and follow traffic regulations. To achieve this goal, the CACC++ communicates with nearby vehicles, using sensor detection, and control of the actuators in the vehicle. This expands on the current capabilities of Adaptive Cruise Control with the intent to make it safer. CACC++ is an embedded system for automotive systems that provides convenience to the operator and provides opportunities for optimization as vehicles send each other signals to communicate. When CACC++ is active, the vehicle will be a part of a platoon, follow the lead vehicle and act appropriately by altering the vehicle's distance and speed based on the communication with the lead vehicle. Another case is that under CACC++ the vehicle is the lead vehicle, in which case it will lead the platoon and communicate with the vehicles behind it. A vehicle will be able to join the platoon through input within the cars user interface, and sometimes the user will be prompted on possible opportunities to join a platoon. The system is intended to support acceleration/deceleration, lateral direction, security precautions, and communication within a platoon. 1.3 Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations ● VC \\u200b : Vehicle Controller, a system within the vehicle that communicates to subsystems and sends information that updates ● CACC++ \\u200b : Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control ● OEM \\u200b : Original Equipment Manufacturer ● \\u200b ITS \\u200b : Intelligent Transport Systems, an application that aims to optimize traffic efficiency and provide safer traffic management ● Target \\u200b : a vehicle or object in front of the vehicle that is being tracked ● GUI \\u200b : Graphical user interface, the screen and buttons with which the user can interact with 1.4 Organization The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 1 contains an overall introduction to the system and its scope. Section 1 further describes the purpose, scope, definitions and abbreviations, and organization of the entire paper. Section 2 contains a high level description of the CACC++. The description includes the perspective and function of the product, as well as expected user characteristics. Assumptions made are discussed, as well as constraints on the system. Lastly, requirements which have been approportioned are listed. Section 3 outlines all of the requirements of the system. The requirements are hierarchically organized and listed in order of importance. Section 4 contains multiple diagrams and models which describe CACC++. Firstly, a Use Case Diagram is shown and described. Then, a Domain Model follows along with detailed data dictionaries to describe the classes within the diagram. Third is Sequence Diagrams which outline some important scenarios within the system. Lastly, State Diagrams are used to describe how the system changes in response to certain triggers. Section 5 contains a description of the prototype as well as instructions on how to run it. Some scenarios within the prototype are then discussed in detail. Section 6 contains the references for the paper, including the link to the team website which contains the prototype. 2  Template based on IEEE Std 830-1998 for SRS.

Section 2.1 contains the context of the system, as well as the constraints on our system. Section 2.2 outlines the main functionality of the system. Section 2.3 describes the average user of our system as well as their expected experience level. Section 2.4 further discusses constraints on the system. In Section 2.5, key assumptions about our system environment will be discussed. And lastly, in Section 2.6 approportioned requirements will be described. 2.1 Product Perspective The CACC++ system is a product to be used in vehicles to expand the current capabilities of Adaptive Cruise Control, with the goal to increase safety. The CACC++ system is made of many smaller subsystems which it coordinates and controls. So, while the CACC++ is an independent system within the vehicle, it still must coordinate with all other major systems within the vehicle. There are many ways in which a user will interact with the system. A user will be able to use buttons on the steering wheel or utilize a center console screen to turn the system on and off. Furthermore, they can make necessary adjustments to the preferred following speed and distance. In addition, the user will be able to use the brakes to disengage the system. Lastly, through the GUI, the user is able to receive feedback from the system. As for hardware constraints, the vehicle must have actuators installed on the throttle and the brakes for the purpose of monitoring and controlling the acceleration of the vehicle. In addition, a radar and camera must be installed at the front of the vehicle to receive information about targets. Other hardware constraints include a GPS system and a radio to communicate with other vehicles. Lastly, a vehicle controller and independent monitoring system must be present in the vehicle for the system to work. Every subsystem must have software to allow for operation and communication within the system. The vehicle controller must also have software to manage all of the subsystems, in addition to software for an independent monitoring system. There must also be software to handle communications from external sources within the radio. The last major constraint of the system is memory. As the system will be embedded on a vehicle, the size of the vehicle's memory limits the system size and the amount of space available for data. This constraint in memory will subsequently affect the software constraints as well. Lastly, certain safety critical systems require a backup memory to allow for system updates to be more easily carried out during operation. 2.2 Product Functions The CACC++ system consists of many different subsystems that are utilized at different times depending on what the vehicle needs to do. These include acceleration, braking, and communication with other vehicles. The CACC++ system handles these 3  Template based on IEEE Std 830-1998 for SRS. Modifications (content and ordering of information) have been made by Betty H.C. Cheng, Michigan State University (chengb at msu.edu) subsystems using sensors, radars, and other data to control the vehicle for the user on the roadway. The product also allows the user to set a safe following distance between themselves and other vehicles. The subsystems help the CACC++ by detecting and communicating with the system so that it will take appropriate action to traffic. The driver can enable the CACC++ system to join or leave a platoon. When the vehicle is part of a platoon, it communicates with other vehicles and uses the information to update the speed and distance to be in uniform with the platoon. The driver can leave the platoon by turning off the system or exiting the lane. During typical use, the system utilizes the GPS and the radio to send GPS packets to platoon vehicles behind the vehicle. The radio is also used to receive GPS packets from platoon vehicles ahead of it. The information from the GPS is combined with data from the radar and camera to track targets, and determine if they are moving or stationary. The information on the target is then used to determine if the system must accelerate, decelerate, brake, or notify the user of any actions they must take. Other functions of the system include communication with ITS and the OEM cloud, and handling system updates. 2.3 User Characteristics The user of the system should be a licensed driver that follows all traffic laws. The user must also be able to read and interact with notifications, alerts, and different types of controls on a screen inside the vehicle. The user is also expected to choose and maintain both the safe following distance and traveling speed when using the system. Lastly, the user must be alert and ready to take control of the vehicle in case of an emergency or system malfunction. 2.4 Constraints As the system controls the acceleration of the vehicle, there are quite a few safety critical properties. Firstly, the system must be independently monitored to ensure that the commands being issued to the different parts of the system are correct. The electronic throttle control and brake by wire must also be fully functional for the system to operate, and if either are determined to be functioning incorrectly, control of the vehicle should be deferred back to the user. If the throttle control and brakes were not operating correctly, unintended acceleration or braking can occur which would put the user at risk. Another safety critical property is a working radar and camera. In certain situations the camera can be used when the radar fails, but if both the radar and camera are not working properly, then control must be deferred once again to the user. The camera and radar are responsible for determining the speed of the vehicle and classifying the target's speed, location, and whether collision will occur. Any error in any of those responsibilities can put the user in danger and compromises safety. In addition, if any of the main system components such as the radar, camera, and actuators are determined to be not functioning properly, then the system should not be 4 \",\n",

Other functions of the system include communication with ITS and the OEM cloud, and handling system updates. 2.3 User Characteristics The user of the system should be a licensed driver that follows all traffic laws. The user must also be able to read and interact with notifications, alerts, and different types of controls on a screen inside the vehicle. The user is also expected to choose and maintain both the safe following distance and traveling speed when using the system. Lastly, the user must be alert and ready to take control of the vehicle in case of an emergency or system malfunction. 2.4 Constraints As the system controls the acceleration of the vehicle, there are quite a few safety critical properties. Firstly, the system must be independently monitored to ensure that the commands being issued to the different parts of the system are correct. The electronic throttle control and brake by wire must also be fully functional for the system to operate, and if either are determined to be functioning incorrectly, control of the vehicle should be deferred back to the user. If the throttle control and brakes were not operating correctly, unintended acceleration or braking can occur which would put the user at risk. Another safety critical property is a working radar and camera. In certain situations the camera can be used when the radar fails, but if both the radar and camera are not working properly, then control must be deferred once again to the user. The camera and radar are responsible for determining the speed of the vehicle and classifying the target\\'s speed, location, and whether collision will occur. Any error in any of those responsibilities can put the user in danger and compromises safety. In addition, if any of the main system components such as the radar, camera, and actuators are determined to be not functioning properly, then the system should not be 4  Template based on IEEE Std 830-1998 for SRS. Modifications (content and ordering of information) have been made by Betty H.C. Cheng, Michigan State University (chengb at msu.edu) allowed to start and take control of the vehicle, as if it does take control, safety will be compromised. Other constraints include signal timing. Messages from the vehicle controller to the actuators and the UI must be nearly instantaneous. If the vehicle controller must issue emergency braking commands to the brakes and the UI, a significant delay in the receipt of that message can cause a collision. For this reason, the timing of these messages must be nearly instantaneous to ensure safety. Lastly, parallel operation of the CACC++ with other systems within the vehicle is another constraint of the system. The CACC++ must not interfere with the operation of other systems in the vehicle. In addition, the vehicle controller and independent monitoring system must be able to handle contradicting messages from different systems within the vehicle and determine the correct action to take. 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies For the development of the CACC++, the vehicle is assumed to have both acceleration and braking potential, and is assumed to be functional. Additionally, it can be assumed that the previous software for cruise control works and the cooperative portion of the software is installed properly. It is assumed that the system will not operate when the vehicle is on unmarked roads. The user operates the vehicle properly and knows when the system should be in use. In addition, it is assumed that the system only operates when all the subsystems are fully functional, and that any loss in functionality is detected through independent monitoring of our system which will then notify the user and defer control back to them. 2.6 Approportioning of Requirements In the future, the CACC++ may evolve to include more security measures to keep user and vehicle data safe and allow for more over-the-air updates. 3 Specific Requirements This section contains a hierarchical list of requirements for the CACC++ system. The requirements are listed in order of importance, and are separated into global invariant, primary, and secondary requirements. The primary requirements are also separated into hardware requirements, software requirements, and security requirements. 1. Global Invariant Requirements 1.1. Prevent Injury to passengers, and ensure the system is not at fault for a collision. 1.2. Always attempt to avoid an imminent collision with a target through applying brakes, notifying the user, and ceasing acceleration. 1.3. Allow the user to regain control of the system when needed. The user should never be \"locked out\" of the system. 5 ',\n",

Independent monitoring of the VC commands should always occur to ensure reliability and integrity. 1.7. Diagnose and correct system issues when they occur, to recover to an operational state, which includes returning control to the user. 1.8. The CACC++ must never operate concurrently with the manual operation by the user and must not interfere with the operation of other systems within the vehicle. 1.9. The CACC++ must be able to operate with a platoon, and if the platoon is not present then the system must operate as Adaptive Cruise Control. 2. Primary Requirements 2.1. Hardware 2.1.1. Long Range Radars - To implement adaptive cruise control and monitor possible obstacles in the way of the driver there needs to be a way to “see\" a great distance in front of the vehicle. 2.1.2. Short Range Radars - Necessary to detect other vehicles or obstacles in closer proximity to the vehicle. Necessary to have them on the sides and rear of the vehicle to implement lane assist, detect vehicles to the right, left or rear of the vehicle, to detect obstacles such as vehicles, pedestrians or objects when driving in reverse, and to detect when a vehicle is approaching too close to the rear of the vehicle. 2.1.3. Cameras - Needed for rear view assistance when driving in reverse, driver monitoring to ensure a driver is available and ready to take over the vehicle when transitioning between CACC++ and manual control, and even for blind spot visibility. Satellite cameras can also be used to give an aerial overview of the vehicle\\'s position on the road. 2.1.4. Actuator Controls - Used to handle the actual functionality of CACC++ from an operating standpoint. Actuators would be responsible for breaking when approaching a vehicle or obstacle in front of or behind the vehicle, changing the trajectory of the vehicle on curves or to implement lane assist, and to accelerate the vehicle to keep the appropriate speed when on slopes or when needed. 2.1.5. Internal Sensors - Allow the system to know specific statuses of internal parts of the vehicle. There are many sensors already present in cars, but the sensors that are pertinent to CACC++ would be sensors that monitor things such as wheel speed, deceleration, assisted braking, acceleration, and other internal functions. 6 '},\n",

Section 2.1 contains the context of the system, as well as the constraints on our system. Section 2.2 outlines the main functionality of the system. Section 2.3 describes the average user of our system as well as their expected experience level. Section 2.4 further discusses constraints on the system. In Section 2.5, key assumptions about our system environment will be discussed. And lastly, in Section 2.6 approportioned requirements will be described. 2.1 Product Perspective The CACC++ system is a product to be used in vehicles to expand the current capabilities of Adaptive Cruise Control, with the goal to increase safety. The CACC++ system is made of many smaller subsystems which it coordinates and controls. So, while the CACC++ is an independent system within the vehicle, it still must coordinate with all other major systems within the vehicle. There are many ways in which a user will interact with the system. A user will be able to use buttons on the steering wheel or utilize a center console screen to turn the system on and off. Furthermore, they can make necessary adjustments to the preferred following speed and distance. In addition, the user will be able to use the brakes to disengage the system. Lastly, through the GUI, the user is able to receive feedback from the system. As for hardware constraints, the vehicle must have actuators installed on the throttle and the brakes for the purpose of monitoring and controlling the acceleration of the vehicle. In addition, a radar and camera must be installed at the front of the vehicle to receive information about targets. Other hardware constraints include a GPS system and a radio to communicate with other vehicles. Lastly, a vehicle controller and independent monitoring system must be present in the vehicle for the system to work. Every subsystem must have software to allow for operation and communication within the system. The vehicle controller must also have software to manage all of the subsystems, in addition to software for an independent monitoring system. There must also be software to handle communications from external sources within the radio. The last major constraint of the system is memory. As the system will be embedded on a vehicle, the size of the vehicle\\'s memory limits the system size and the amount of space available for data. This constraint in memory will subsequently affect the software constraints as well. Lastly, certain safety critical systems require a backup memory to allow for system updates to be more easily carried out during operation. 2.2 Product Functions The CACC++ system consists of many different subsystems that are utilized at different times depending on what the vehicle needs to do. These include acceleration, braking, and communication with other vehicles. The CACC++ system handles these 3  Template based on IEEE Std 830-1998 for SRS.

       "  'What are the assumptions and dependencies': {1: \"Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Project CACC++ 2 Authors: Erich Hairston, Dean Dawson, Gabrie Italia, Evan Shoup, Kaela Burger Customer: Mr. Bill Milam Instructor: Dr. Betty Cheng 1 Introduction Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control++ (CACC++) is a system which expands the current capabilities of Adaptive Cruise Control to make the system safer and easier to use. CACC++ enables a vehicle to follow a platoon with the use of sensors to detect nearby vehicles and follow safety procedures, while maintaining a constant speed and distance set by the driver. To achieve an advanced system, key points such as functionality, requirements, constraints, and dependencies highlight the importance of the necessary details in the CACC++ system. Models are included to provide more detailed interpretations, as well as a prototype that demonstrates several scenarios in which the system behaves. The CACC++ system contains subsystems that include sensors, communication, and control of the vehicle to function without the dependency of an operator. 1.1 Purpose A functional CACC++ relies on its underlying subsystems and allows the interaction between infrastructure and the vehicle with the appropriate actions to such scenarios. The purpose of the software requirements specification is to help the customer understand the team’s interpretation of the product and their approach on how to achieve a system that follows the requirements. Several diagrams are provided that describe the CACC++ system in detail and how it is used daily to provide a better understanding for the reader. A domain model is included, which maps out the main components of the system. A use case diagram is also added, which models common high level behaviors of the system. Sequence diagrams, which describe the interactions between the classes in the domain model in different scenarios are also included. And lastly, state diagrams are included which describe how components of our system move through different states and respond to outside messages. 1.2 Scope CACC++ is a system available in a vehicle that allows the driver to let the vehicle operate independently and follow traffic regulations. To achieve this goal, the CACC++ communicates with nearby vehicles, using sensor detection, and control of the actuators in the vehicle. This expands on the current capabilities of Adaptive Cruise Control with the intent to make it safer. CACC++ is an embedded system for automotive systems that provides convenience to the operator and provides opportunities for optimization as vehicles send each other signals to communicate. When CACC++ is active, the vehicle will be a part of a platoon, follow the lead vehicle and act appropriately by altering the vehicle's distance and speed based on the communication with the lead vehicle. Another case is that under CACC++ the vehicle is the lead vehicle, in which case it will lead the platoon and communicate with the vehicles behind it. A vehicle will be able to join the platoon through input within the cars user interface, and sometimes the user will be prompted on possible opportunities to join a platoon. The system is intended to support acceleration/deceleration, lateral direction, security precautions, and communication within a platoon. 1.3 Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations ● VC \\u200b : Vehicle Controller, a system within the vehicle that communicates to subsystems and sends information that updates ● CACC++ \\u200b : Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control ● OEM \\u200b : Original Equipment Manufacturer ● \\u200b ITS \\u200b : Intelligent Transport Systems, an application that aims to optimize traffic efficiency and provide safer traffic management ● Target \\u200b : a vehicle or object in front of the vehicle that is being tracked ● GUI \\u200b : Graphical user interface, the screen and buttons with which the user can interact with 1.4 Organization The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

Cheng, Michigan State University (chengb at msu.edu) allowed to start and take control of the vehicle, as if it does take control, safety will be compromised. Other constraints include signal timing. Messages from the vehicle controller to the actuators and the UI must be nearly instantaneous. If the vehicle controller must issue emergency braking commands to the brakes and the UI, a significant delay in the receipt of that message can cause a collision. For this reason, the timing of these messages must be nearly instantaneous to ensure safety. Lastly, parallel operation of the CACC++ with other systems within the vehicle is another constraint of the system. The CACC++ must not interfere with the operation of other systems in the vehicle. In addition, the vehicle controller and independent monitoring system must be able to handle contradicting messages from different systems within the vehicle and determine the correct action to take. 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies For the development of the CACC++, the vehicle is assumed to have both acceleration and braking potential, and is assumed to be functional. Additionally, it can be assumed that the previous software for cruise control works and the cooperative portion of the software is installed properly. It is assumed that the system will not operate when the vehicle is on unmarked roads. The user operates the vehicle properly and knows when the system should be in use. In addition, it is assumed that the system only operates when all the subsystems are fully functional, and that any loss in functionality is detected through independent monitoring of our system which will then notify the user and defer control back to them. 2.6 Approportioning of Requirements In the future, the CACC++ may evolve to include more security measures to keep user and vehicle data safe and allow for more over-the-air updates. 3 Specific Requirements This section contains a hierarchical list of requirements for the CACC++ system. The requirements are listed in order of importance, and are separated into global invariant, primary, and secondary requirements. The primary requirements are also separated into hardware requirements, software requirements, and security requirements. 1. Global Invariant Requirements 1.1. Prevent Injury to passengers, and ensure the system is not at fault for a collision. 1.2. Always attempt to avoid an imminent collision with a target through applying brakes, notifying the user, and ceasing acceleration. 1.3. Allow the user to regain control of the system when needed. The user should never be \"locked out\" of the system. 5  Template based on IEEE Std 830-1998 for SRS. Modifications (content and ordering of information) have been made by Betty H.C. Cheng, Michigan State University (chengb at msu.edu) 1.4. Acceleration should not be applied when the distance to the target is below a safe distance. 1.5. Ensure Safe Operation of the vehicle when the system is active by following speed limits and traffic laws. 1.6. Independent monitoring of the VC commands should always occur to ensure reliability and integrity. 1.7. Diagnose and correct system issues when they occur, to recover to an operational state, which includes returning control to the user. 1.8. The CACC++ must never operate concurrently with the manual operation by the user and must not interfere with the operation of other systems within the vehicle. 1.9. The CACC++ must be able to operate with a platoon, and if the platoon is not present then the system must operate as Adaptive Cruise Control. 2. Primary Requirements 2.1. Hardware 2.1.1. Long Range Radars - To implement adaptive cruise control and monitor possible obstacles in the way of the driver there needs to be a way to “see\" a great distance in front of the vehicle. 2.1.2. Short Range Radars - Necessary to detect other vehicles or obstacles in closer proximity to the vehicle. Necessary to have them on the sides and rear of the vehicle to implement lane assist, detect vehicles to the right, left or rear of the vehicle, to detect obstacles such as vehicles, pedestrians or objects when driving in reverse, and to detect when a vehicle is approaching too close to the rear of the vehicle. 2.1.3. Cameras - Needed for rear view assistance when driving in reverse, driver monitoring to ensure a driver is available and ready to take over the vehicle when transitioning between CACC++ and manual control, and even for blind spot visibility. Satellite cameras can also be used to give an aerial overview of the vehicle\\'s position on the road. 2.1.4. Actuator Controls - Used to handle the actual functionality of CACC++ from an operating standpoint. Actuators would be responsible for breaking when approaching a vehicle or obstacle in front of or behind the vehicle, changing the trajectory of the vehicle on curves or to implement lane assist, and to accelerate the vehicle to keep the appropriate speed when on slopes or when needed. 2.1.5. Internal Sensors - Allow the system to know specific statuses of internal parts of the vehicle. There are many sensors already present in cars, but the sensors that are pertinent to CACC++ would be sensors that monitor things such as wheel speed, deceleration, assisted braking, acceleration, and other internal functions. 6 ',\n",

Section 2.1 contains the context of the system, as well as the constraints on our system. Section 2.2 outlines the main functionality of the system. Section 2.3 describes the average user of our system as well as their expected experience level. Section 2.4 further discusses constraints on the system. In Section 2.5, key assumptions about our system environment will be discussed. And lastly, in Section 2.6 approportioned requirements will be described. 2.1 Product Perspective The CACC++ system is a product to be used in vehicles to expand the current capabilities of Adaptive Cruise Control, with the goal to increase safety. The CACC++ system is made of many smaller subsystems which it coordinates and controls. So, while the CACC++ is an independent system within the vehicle, it still must coordinate with all other major systems within the vehicle. There are many ways in which a user will interact with the system. A user will be able to use buttons on the steering wheel or utilize a center console screen to turn the system on and off. Furthermore, they can make necessary adjustments to the preferred following speed and distance. In addition, the user will be able to use the brakes to disengage the system. Lastly, through the GUI, the user is able to receive feedback from the system. As for hardware constraints, the vehicle must have actuators installed on the throttle and the brakes for the purpose of monitoring and controlling the acceleration of the vehicle. In addition, a radar and camera must be installed at the front of the vehicle to receive information about targets. Other hardware constraints include a GPS system and a radio to communicate with other vehicles. Lastly, a vehicle controller and independent monitoring system must be present in the vehicle for the system to work. Every subsystem must have software to allow for operation and communication within the system. The vehicle controller must also have software to manage all of the subsystems, in addition to software for an independent monitoring system. There must also be software to handle communications from external sources within the radio. The last major constraint of the system is memory. As the system will be embedded on a vehicle, the size of the vehicle\\'s memory limits the system size and the amount of space available for data. This constraint in memory will subsequently affect the software constraints as well. Lastly, certain safety critical systems require a backup memory to allow for system updates to be more easily carried out during operation. 2.2 Product Functions The CACC++ system consists of many different subsystems that are utilized at different times depending on what the vehicle needs to do. These include acceleration, braking, and communication with other vehicles. The CACC++ system handles these 3  Template based on IEEE Std 830-1998 for SRS. Modifications (content and ordering of information) have been made by Betty H.C. Cheng, Michigan State University (chengb at msu.edu) subsystems using sensors, radars, and other data to control the vehicle for the user on the roadway. The product also allows the user to set a safe following distance between themselves and other vehicles. The subsystems help the CACC++ by detecting and communicating with the system so that it will take appropriate action to traffic. The driver can enable the CACC++ system to join or leave a platoon. When the vehicle is part of a platoon, it communicates with other vehicles and uses the information to update the speed and distance to be in uniform with the platoon. The driver can leave the platoon by turning off the system or exiting the lane. During typical use, the system utilizes the GPS and the radio to send GPS packets to platoon vehicles behind the vehicle. The radio is also used to receive GPS packets from platoon vehicles ahead of it. The information from the GPS is combined with data from the radar and camera to track targets, and determine if they are moving or stationary. The information on the target is then used to determine if the system must accelerate, decelerate, brake, or notify the user of any actions they must take. Other functions of the system include communication with ITS and the OEM cloud, and handling system updates. 2.3 User Characteristics The user of the system should be a licensed driver that follows all traffic laws. The user must also be able to read and interact with notifications, alerts, and different types of controls on a screen inside the vehicle. The user is also expected to choose and maintain both the safe following distance and traveling speed when using the system. Lastly, the user must be alert and ready to take control of the vehicle in case of an emergency or system malfunction. 2.4 Constraints As the system controls the acceleration of the vehicle, there are quite a few safety critical properties. Firstly, the system must be independently monitored to ensure that the commands being issued to the different parts of the system are correct. The electronic throttle control and brake by wire must also be fully functional for the system to operate, and if either are determined to be functioning incorrectly, control of the vehicle should be deferred back to the user. If the throttle control and brakes were not operating correctly, unintended acceleration or braking can occur which would put the user at risk. Another safety critical property is a working radar and camera. In certain situations the camera can be used when the radar fails, but if both the radar and camera are not working properly, then control must be deferred once again to the user. The camera and radar are responsible for determining the speed of the vehicle and classifying the target\\'s speed, location, and whether collision will occur. Any error in any of those responsibilities can put the user in danger and compromises safety. In addition, if any of the main system components such as the radar, camera, and actuators are determined to be not functioning properly, then the system should not be 4  Template based on IEEE Std 830-1998 for SRS.

In addition, the vehicle controller and independent monitoring system must be able to handle contradicting messages from different systems within the vehicle and determine the correct action to take. 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies For the development of the CACC++, the vehicle is assumed to have both acceleration and braking potential, and is assumed to be functional.

CACC++ enables a vehicle to follow a platoon with the use of sensors to detect nearby vehicles and follow safety procedures, while maintaining a constant speed and distance set by the driver. To achieve an advanced system, key points such as functionality, requirements, constraints, and dependencies highlight the importance of the necessary details in the CACC++ system. Models are included to provide more detailed interpretations, as well as a prototype that demonstrates several scenarios in which the system behaves. The CACC++ system contains subsystems that include sensors, communication, and control of the vehicle to function without the dependency of an operator. 1.1 Purpose A functional CACC++ relies on its underlying subsystems and allows the interaction between infrastructure and the vehicle with the appropriate actions to such scenarios. The purpose of the software requirements specification is to help the customer understand the team’s interpretation of the product and their approach on how to achieve a system that follows the requirements. Several diagrams are provided that describe the CACC++ system in detail and how it is used daily to provide a better understanding for the reader. A domain model is included, which maps out the main components of the system. A use case diagram is also added, which models common high level behaviors of the system. Sequence diagrams, which describe the interactions between the classes in the domain model in different scenarios are also included. And lastly, state diagrams are included which describe how components of our system move through different states and respond to outside messages. 1.2 Scope CACC++ is a system available in a vehicle that allows the driver to let the vehicle operate independently and follow traffic regulations. To achieve this goal, the CACC++ communicates with nearby vehicles, using sensor detection, and control of the actuators in the vehicle. This expands on the current capabilities of Adaptive Cruise Control with the intent to make it safer. CACC++ is an embedded system for automotive systems that provides convenience to the operator and provides opportunities for optimization as vehicles send each other signals to communicate. When CACC++ is active, the vehicle will be a part of a platoon, follow the lead vehicle and act appropriately by altering the vehicle's distance and speed based on the communication with the lead vehicle. Another case is that under CACC++ the vehicle is the lead vehicle, in which case it will lead the platoon and communicate with the vehicles behind it. A vehicle will be able to join the platoon through input within the cars user interface, and sometimes the user will be prompted on possible opportunities to join a platoon. The system is intended to support acceleration/deceleration, lateral direction, security precautions, and communication within a platoon. 1.3 Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations ● VC \\u200b : Vehicle Controller, a system within the vehicle that communicates to subsystems and sends information that updates ● CACC++ \\u200b : Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control ● OEM \\u200b : Original Equipment Manufacturer ● \\u200b ITS \\u200b : Intelligent Transport Systems, an application that aims to optimize traffic efficiency and provide safer traffic management ● Target \\u200b : a vehicle or object in front of the vehicle that is being tracked ● GUI \\u200b : Graphical user interface, the screen and buttons with which the user can interact with 1.4 Organization The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

The information from the GPS is combined with data from the radar and camera to track targets, and determine if they are moving or stationary. The information on the target is then used to determine if the system must accelerate, decelerate, brake, or notify the user of any actions they must take. Other functions of the system include communication with ITS and the OEM cloud, and handling system updates. 2.3 User Characteristics The user of the system should be a licensed driver that follows all traffic laws. The user must also be able to read and interact with notifications, alerts, and different types of controls on a screen inside the vehicle. The user is also expected to choose and maintain both the safe following distance and traveling speed when using the system.

In certain situations the camera can be used when the radar fails, but if both the radar and camera are not working properly, then control must be deferred once again to the user. The camera and radar are responsible for determining the speed of the vehicle and classifying the target's speed, location, and whether collision will occur.

There are many ways in which a user will interact with the system. A user will be able to use buttons on the steering wheel or utilize a center console screen to turn the system on and off. Furthermore, they can make necessary adjustments to the preferred following speed and distance. In addition, the user will be able to use the brakes to disengage the system. Lastly, through the GUI, the user is able to receive feedback from the system. As for hardware constraints, the vehicle must have actuators installed on the throttle and the brakes for the purpose of monitoring and controlling the acceleration of the vehicle. In addition, a radar and camera must be installed at the front of the vehicle to receive information about targets. Other hardware constraints include a GPS system and a radio to communicate with other vehicles. Lastly, a vehicle controller and independent monitoring system must be present in the vehicle for the system to work. Every subsystem must have software to allow for operation and communication within the system. The vehicle controller must also have software to manage all of the subsystems, in addition to software for an independent monitoring system. There must also be software to handle communications from external sources within the radio. The last major constraint of the system is memory. As the system will be embedded on a vehicle, the size of the vehicle\\'s memory limits the system size and the amount of space available for data. This constraint in memory will subsequently affect the software constraints as well. Lastly, certain safety critical systems require a backup memory to allow for system updates to be more easily carried out during operation. 2.2 Product Functions The CACC++ system consists of many different subsystems that are utilized at different times depending on what the vehicle needs to do. These include acceleration, braking, and communication with other vehicles. The CACC++ system handles these 3  Template based on IEEE Std 830-1998 for SRS. Modifications (content and ordering of information) have been made by Betty H.C. Cheng, Michigan State University (chengb at msu.edu) subsystems using sensors, radars, and other data to control the vehicle for the user on the roadway. The product also allows the user to set a safe following distance between themselves and other vehicles. The subsystems help the CACC++ by detecting and communicating with the system so that it will take appropriate action to traffic. The driver can enable the CACC++ system to join or leave a platoon. When the vehicle is part of a platoon, it communicates with other vehicles and uses the information to update the speed and distance to be in uniform with the platoon. The driver can leave the platoon by turning off the system or exiting the lane. During typical use, the system utilizes the GPS and the radio to send GPS packets to platoon vehicles behind the vehicle. The radio is also used to receive GPS packets from platoon vehicles ahead of it. The information from the GPS is combined with data from the radar and camera to track targets, and determine if they are moving or stationary. The information on the target is then used to determine if the system must accelerate, decelerate, brake, or notify the user of any actions they must take. Other functions of the system include communication with ITS and the OEM cloud, and handling system updates. 2.3 User Characteristics The user of the system should be a licensed driver that follows all traffic laws. The user must also be able to read and interact with notifications, alerts, and different types of controls on a screen inside the vehicle. The user is also expected to choose and maintain both the safe following distance and traveling speed when using the system. Lastly, the user must be alert and ready to take control of the vehicle in case of an emergency or system malfunction. 2.4 Constraints As the system controls the acceleration of the vehicle, there are quite a few safety critical properties. Firstly, the system must be independently monitored to ensure that the commands being issued to the different parts of the system are correct. The electronic throttle control and brake by wire must also be fully functional for the system to operate, and if either are determined to be functioning incorrectly, control of the vehicle should be deferred back to the user. If the throttle control and brakes were not operating correctly, unintended acceleration or braking can occur which would put the user at risk. Another safety critical property is a working radar and camera. In certain situations the camera can be used when the radar fails, but if both the radar and camera are not working properly, then control must be deferred once again to the user. The camera and radar are responsible for determining the speed of the vehicle and classifying the target\\'s speed, location, and whether collision will occur. Any error in any of those responsibilities can put the user in danger and compromises safety. In addition, if any of the main system components such as the radar, camera, and actuators are determined to be not functioning properly, then the system should not be 4  Template based on IEEE Std 830-1998 for SRS. Modifications (content and ordering of information) have been made by Betty H.C. Cheng, Michigan State University (chengb at msu.edu) allowed to start and take control of the vehicle, as if it does take control, safety will be compromised. Other constraints include signal timing. Messages from the vehicle controller to the actuators and the UI must be nearly instantaneous. If the vehicle controller must issue emergency braking commands to the brakes and the UI, a significant delay in the receipt of that message can cause a collision. For this reason, the timing of these messages must be nearly instantaneous to ensure safety. Lastly, parallel operation of the CACC++ with other systems within the vehicle is another constraint of the system. The CACC++ must not interfere with the operation of other systems in the vehicle. In addition, the vehicle controller and independent monitoring system must be able to handle contradicting messages from different systems within the vehicle and determine the correct action to take. 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies For the development of the CACC++, the vehicle is assumed to have both acceleration and braking potential, and is assumed to be functional. Additionally, it can be assumed that the previous software for cruise control works and the cooperative portion of the software is installed properly. It is assumed that the system will not operate when the vehicle is on unmarked roads. The user operates the vehicle properly and knows when the system should be in use. In addition, it is assumed that the system only operates when all the subsystems are fully functional, and that any loss in functionality is detected through independent monitoring of our system which will then notify the user and defer control back to them. 2.6 Approportioning of Requirements In the future, the CACC++ may evolve to include more security measures to keep user and vehicle data safe and allow for more over-the-air updates. 3 Specific Requirements This section contains a hierarchical list of requirements for the CACC++ system. The requirements are listed in order of importance, and are separated into global invariant, primary, and secondary requirements. The primary requirements are also separated into hardware requirements, software requirements, and security requirements. 1. Global Invariant Requirements 1.1. Prevent Injury to passengers, and ensure the system is not at fault for a collision. 1.2. Always attempt to avoid an imminent collision with a target through applying brakes, notifying the user, and ceasing acceleration. 1.3. Allow the user to regain control of the system when needed. The user should never be \"locked out\" of the system. 5 ',\n",

CACC++ enables a vehicle to follow a platoon with the use of sensors to detect nearby vehicles and follow safety procedures, while maintaining a constant speed and distance set by the driver. To achieve an advanced system, key points such as functionality, requirements, constraints, and dependencies highlight the importance of the necessary details in the CACC++ system. Models are included to provide more detailed interpretations, as well as a prototype that demonstrates several scenarios in which the system behaves. The CACC++ system contains subsystems that include sensors, communication, and control of the vehicle to function without the dependency of an operator. 1.1 Purpose A functional CACC++ relies on its underlying subsystems and allows the interaction between infrastructure and the vehicle with the appropriate actions to such scenarios. The purpose of the software requirements specification is to help the customer understand the team’s interpretation of the product and their approach on how to achieve a system that follows the requirements. Several diagrams are provided that describe the CACC++ system in detail and how it is used daily to provide a better understanding for the reader. A domain model is included, which maps out the main components of the system. A use case diagram is also added, which models common high level behaviors of the system. Sequence diagrams, which describe the interactions between the classes in the domain model in different scenarios are also included. And lastly, state diagrams are included which describe how components of our system move through different states and respond to outside messages. 1.2 Scope CACC++ is a system available in a vehicle that allows the driver to let the vehicle operate independently and follow traffic regulations. To achieve this goal, the CACC++ communicates with nearby vehicles, using sensor detection, and control of the actuators in the vehicle. This expands on the current capabilities of Adaptive Cruise Control with the intent to make it safer. CACC++ is an embedded system for automotive systems that provides convenience to the operator and provides opportunities for optimization as vehicles send each other signals to communicate. When CACC++ is active, the vehicle will be a part of a platoon, follow the lead vehicle and act appropriately by altering the vehicle's distance and speed based on the communication with the lead vehicle. Another case is that under CACC++ the vehicle is the lead vehicle, in which case it will lead the platoon and communicate with the vehicles behind it. A vehicle will be able to join the platoon through input within the cars user interface, and sometimes the user will be prompted on possible opportunities to join a platoon. The system is intended to support acceleration/deceleration, lateral direction, security precautions, and communication within a platoon. 1.3 Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations ● VC \\u200b : Vehicle Controller, a system within the vehicle that communicates to subsystems and sends information that updates ● CACC++ \\u200b : Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control ● OEM \\u200b : Original Equipment Manufacturer ● \\u200b ITS \\u200b : Intelligent Transport Systems, an application that aims to optimize traffic efficiency and provide safer traffic management ● Target \\u200b : a vehicle or object in front of the vehicle that is being tracked ● GUI \\u200b : Graphical user interface, the screen and buttons with which the user can interact with 1.4 Organization The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

And lastly, in Section 2.6 approportioned requirements will be described. 2.1 Product Perspective The CACC++ system is a product to be used in vehicles to expand the current capabilities of Adaptive Cruise Control, with the goal to increase safety. The CACC++ system is made of many smaller subsystems which it coordinates and controls. So, while the CACC++ is an independent system within the vehicle, it still must coordinate with all other major systems within the vehicle. There are many ways in which a user will interact with the system. A user will be able to use buttons on the steering wheel or utilize a center console screen to turn the system on and off. Furthermore, they can make necessary adjustments to the preferred following speed and distance. In addition, the user will be able to use the brakes to disengage the system. Lastly, through the GUI, the user is able to receive feedback from the system. As for hardware constraints, the vehicle must have actuators installed on the throttle and the brakes for the purpose of monitoring and controlling the acceleration of the vehicle. In addition, a radar and camera must be installed at the front of the vehicle to receive information about targets. Other hardware constraints include a GPS system and a radio to communicate with other vehicles. Lastly, a vehicle controller and independent monitoring system must be present in the vehicle for the system to work. Every subsystem must have software to allow for operation and communication within the system. The vehicle controller must also have software to manage all of the subsystems, in addition to software for an independent monitoring system. There must also be software to handle communications from external sources within the radio. The last major constraint of the system is memory. As the system will be embedded on a vehicle, the size of the vehicle's memory limits the system size and the amount of space available for data. This constraint in memory will subsequently affect the software constraints as well. Lastly, certain safety critical systems require a backup memory to allow for system updates to be more easily carried out during operation. 2.2 Product Functions The CACC++ system consists of many different subsystems that are utilized at different times depending on what the vehicle needs to do. These include acceleration, braking, and communication with other vehicles. The CACC++ system handles these 3  Template based on IEEE Std 830-1998 for SRS. Modifications (content and ordering of information) have been made by Betty H.C. Cheng, Michigan State University (chengb at msu.edu) subsystems using sensors, radars, and other data to control the vehicle for the user on the roadway. The product also allows the user to set a safe following distance between themselves and other vehicles. The subsystems help the CACC++ by detecting and communicating with the system so that it will take appropriate action to traffic. The driver can enable the CACC++ system to join or leave a platoon. When the vehicle is part of a platoon, it communicates with other vehicles and uses the information to update the speed and distance to be in uniform with the platoon. The driver can leave the platoon by turning off the system or exiting the lane. During typical use, the system utilizes the GPS and the radio to send GPS packets to platoon vehicles behind the vehicle. The radio is also used to receive GPS packets from platoon vehicles ahead of it. The information from the GPS is combined with data from the radar and camera to track targets, and determine if they are moving or stationary. The information on the target is then used to determine if the system must accelerate, decelerate, brake, or notify the user of any actions they must take. Other functions of the system include communication with ITS and the OEM cloud, and handling system updates. 2.3 User Characteristics The user of the system should be a licensed driver that follows all traffic laws. The user must also be able to read and interact with notifications, alerts, and different types of controls on a screen inside the vehicle. The user is also expected to choose and maintain both the safe following distance and traveling speed when using the system. Lastly, the user must be alert and ready to take control of the vehicle in case of an emergency or system malfunction. 2.4 Constraints As the system controls the acceleration of the vehicle, there are quite a few safety critical properties. Firstly, the system must be independently monitored to ensure that the commands being issued to the different parts of the system are correct. The electronic throttle control and brake by wire must also be fully functional for the system to operate, and if either are determined to be functioning incorrectly, control of the vehicle should be deferred back to the user. If the throttle control and brakes were not operating correctly, unintended acceleration or braking can occur which would put the user at risk. Another safety critical property is a working radar and camera. In certain situations the camera can be used when the radar fails, but if both the radar and camera are not working properly, then control must be deferred once again to the user. The camera and radar are responsible for determining the speed of the vehicle and classifying the target's speed, location, and whether collision will occur.

Section 2.1 contains the context of the system, as well as the constraints on our system. Section 2.2 outlines the main functionality of the system. Section 2.3 describes the average user of our system as well as their expected experience level. Section 2.4 further discusses constraints on the system. In Section 2.5, key assumptions about our system environment will be discussed. And lastly, in Section 2.6 approportioned requirements will be described. 2.1 Product Perspective The CACC++ system is a product to be used in vehicles to expand the current capabilities of Adaptive Cruise Control, with the goal to increase safety. The CACC++ system is made of many smaller subsystems which it coordinates and controls. So, while the CACC++ is an independent system within the vehicle, it still must coordinate with all other major systems within the vehicle. There are many ways in which a user will interact with the system. A user will be able to use buttons on the steering wheel or utilize a center console screen to turn the system on and off. Furthermore, they can make necessary adjustments to the preferred following speed and distance. In addition, the user will be able to use the brakes to disengage the system. Lastly, through the GUI, the user is able to receive feedback from the system. As for hardware constraints, the vehicle must have actuators installed on the throttle and the brakes for the purpose of monitoring and controlling the acceleration of the vehicle. In addition, a radar and camera must be installed at the front of the vehicle to receive information about targets. Other hardware constraints include a GPS system and a radio to communicate with other vehicles. Lastly, a vehicle controller and independent monitoring system must be present in the vehicle for the system to work. Every subsystem must have software to allow for operation and communication within the system. The vehicle controller must also have software to manage all of the subsystems, in addition to software for an independent monitoring system. There must also be software to handle communications from external sources within the radio. The last major constraint of the system is memory. As the system will be embedded on a vehicle, the size of the vehicle\\'s memory limits the system size and the amount of space available for data. This constraint in memory will subsequently affect the software constraints as well. Lastly, certain safety critical systems require a backup memory to allow for system updates to be more easily carried out during operation. 2.2 Product Functions The CACC++ system consists of many different subsystems that are utilized at different times depending on what the vehicle needs to do. These include acceleration, braking, and communication with other vehicles. The CACC++ system handles these 3  Template based on IEEE Std 830-1998 for SRS. Modifications (content and ordering of information) have been made by Betty H.C. Cheng, Michigan State University (chengb at msu.edu) subsystems using sensors, radars, and other data to control the vehicle for the user on the roadway. The product also allows the user to set a safe following distance between themselves and other vehicles. The subsystems help the CACC++ by detecting and communicating with the system so that it will take appropriate action to traffic. The driver can enable the CACC++ system to join or leave a platoon. When the vehicle is part of a platoon, it communicates with other vehicles and uses the information to update the speed and distance to be in uniform with the platoon. The driver can leave the platoon by turning off the system or exiting the lane. During typical use, the system utilizes the GPS and the radio to send GPS packets to platoon vehicles behind the vehicle. The radio is also used to receive GPS packets from platoon vehicles ahead of it. The information from the GPS is combined with data from the radar and camera to track targets, and determine if they are moving or stationary. The information on the target is then used to determine if the system must accelerate, decelerate, brake, or notify the user of any actions they must take. Other functions of the system include communication with ITS and the OEM cloud, and handling system updates. 2.3 User Characteristics The user of the system should be a licensed driver that follows all traffic laws. The user must also be able to read and interact with notifications, alerts, and different types of controls on a screen inside the vehicle. The user is also expected to choose and maintain both the safe following distance and traveling speed when using the system. Lastly, the user must be alert and ready to take control of the vehicle in case of an emergency or system malfunction. 2.4 Constraints As the system controls the acceleration of the vehicle, there are quite a few safety critical properties. Firstly, the system must be independently monitored to ensure that the commands being issued to the different parts of the system are correct. The electronic throttle control and brake by wire must also be fully functional for the system to operate, and if either are determined to be functioning incorrectly, control of the vehicle should be deferred back to the user. If the throttle control and brakes were not operating correctly, unintended acceleration or braking can occur which would put the user at risk. Another safety critical property is a working radar and camera. In certain situations the camera can be used when the radar fails, but if both the radar and camera are not working properly, then control must be deferred once again to the user. The camera and radar are responsible for determining the speed of the vehicle and classifying the target\\'s speed, location, and whether collision will occur. Any error in any of those responsibilities can put the user in danger and compromises safety. In addition, if any of the main system components such as the radar, camera, and actuators are determined to be not functioning properly, then the system should not be 4  Template based on IEEE Std 830-1998 for SRS. Modifications (content and ordering of information) have been made by Betty H.C. Cheng, Michigan State University (chengb at msu.edu) allowed to start and take control of the vehicle, as if it does take control, safety will be compromised. Other constraints include signal timing. Messages from the vehicle controller to the actuators and the UI must be nearly instantaneous. If the vehicle controller must issue emergency braking commands to the brakes and the UI, a significant delay in the receipt of that message can cause a collision. For this reason, the timing of these messages must be nearly instantaneous to ensure safety. Lastly, parallel operation of the CACC++ with other systems within the vehicle is another constraint of the system. The CACC++ must not interfere with the operation of other systems in the vehicle. In addition, the vehicle controller and independent monitoring system must be able to handle contradicting messages from different systems within the vehicle and determine the correct action to take. 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies For the development of the CACC++, the vehicle is assumed to have both acceleration and braking potential, and is assumed to be functional. Additionally, it can be assumed that the previous software for cruise control works and the cooperative portion of the software is installed properly. It is assumed that the system will not operate when the vehicle is on unmarked roads. The user operates the vehicle properly and knows when the system should be in use. In addition, it is assumed that the system only operates when all the subsystems are fully functional, and that any loss in functionality is detected through independent monitoring of our system which will then notify the user and defer control back to them. 2.6 Approportioning of Requirements In the future, the CACC++ may evolve to include more security measures to keep user and vehicle data safe and allow for more over-the-air updates. 3 Specific Requirements This section contains a hierarchical list of requirements for the CACC++ system. The requirements are listed in order of importance, and are separated into global invariant, primary, and secondary requirements. The primary requirements are also separated into hardware requirements, software requirements, and security requirements. 1. Global Invariant Requirements 1.1. Prevent Injury to passengers, and ensure the system is not at fault for a collision. 1.2. Always attempt to avoid an imminent collision with a target through applying brakes, notifying the user, and ceasing acceleration. 1.3. Allow the user to regain control of the system when needed.

Ensure Safe Operation of the vehicle when the system is active by following speed limits and traffic laws. 1.6. Independent monitoring of the VC commands should always occur to ensure reliability and integrity. 1.7. Diagnose and correct system issues when they occur, to recover to an operational state, which includes returning control to the user. 1.8. The CACC++ must never operate concurrently with the manual operation by the user and must not interfere with the operation of other systems within the vehicle. 1.9. The CACC++ must be able to operate with a platoon, and if the platoon is not present then the system must operate as Adaptive Cruise Control. 2. Primary Requirements 2.1. Hardware 2.1.1. Long Range Radars - To implement adaptive cruise control and monitor possible obstacles in the way of the driver there needs to be a way to “see\" a great distance in front of the vehicle. 2.1.2. Short Range Radars - Necessary to detect other vehicles or obstacles in closer proximity to the vehicle. Necessary to have them on the sides and rear of the vehicle to implement lane assist, detect vehicles to the right, left or rear of the vehicle, to detect obstacles such as vehicles, pedestrians or objects when driving in reverse, and to detect when a vehicle is approaching too close to the rear of the vehicle. 2.1.3. Cameras - Needed for rear view assistance when driving in reverse, driver monitoring to ensure a driver is available and ready to take over the vehicle when transitioning between CACC++ and manual control, and even for blind spot visibility. Satellite cameras can also be used to give an aerial overview of the vehicle\\'s position on the road. 2.1.4. Actuator Controls - Used to handle the actual functionality of CACC++ from an operating standpoint. Actuators would be responsible for breaking when approaching a vehicle or obstacle in front of or behind the vehicle, changing the trajectory of the vehicle on curves or to implement lane assist, and to accelerate the vehicle to keep the appropriate speed when on slopes or when needed. 2.1.5. Internal Sensors - Allow the system to know specific statuses of internal parts of the vehicle. There are many sensors already present in cars, but the sensors that are pertinent to CACC++ would be sensors that monitor things such as wheel speed, deceleration, assisted braking, acceleration, and other internal functions. 6 '},\n",

These tragedies disproportionately impact vulnerable populations like young children and the elderly [11]. We propose this Pedestrian Backup Assist System (PBAS) to enhance vehicle safety while backing in order to reduce serious backup collisions. Without PBAS, a driver may not see a small child behind the vehicle in the mirrors or out the windows, leading to a backup accident. Therefore, PBAS provides the driver with a video feed of the scene behind the vehicle, so he or she can better see behind the vehicle. PBAS also automatically detects pedestrians and obstacles behind the car and alerts the driver if the vehicle is close to something with aural and visual alarms, since a combination of both warning types were more effective than either one alone in studies [1, 8]. Additionally, PBAS provides similar auditory alarms outside the vehicle to alert pedestrians that the vehicle is backing, so the pedestrian has a warning that he or she should move to safety. PBAS also provides automatic mitigation if a backup collision is imminent. Instead of solely relying on the driver, who may be distracted, to brake, PBAS engages the vehicle’s braking system to slow the vehicle if a collision is likely and the driver has not taken evasive action.

This section discusses the choice of prioritization methods and gives a suggestion of how the release plan for these requirements could look like. 4.1 Choice of prioritization method  When prioritizing the requirements the ten most important ones were picked out first. This was done with a simple “1 to 10” ranking method, with one being “not important” and ten “very important”. Based on the elicitation meetings, and the perceived ideas of what was important to the different stakeholders, a number was set for each requirement. The numbers were then summed up for each requirement and the ten with the highest score were chosen to be prioritized with the cost value approach. The results, which are red-marked, can be seen in Appendix I and as shown, it turned out to be five functional requirements and five quality requirements. These requirements were then prioritized according to the cost value approach and the results can be viewed under Appendix II.  The remaining requirements were prioritized according to the “Five-Way Priority Scheme” as shown in Appendix III. This method was chosen since it gives the different stakeholders the same importance and has an enough wide range for determining which requirement is more important than the other [3]. However, in this prioritization process, the development team was not included as a stakeholder since the different features were not considered to be as important to them as for the other stakeholders.

Prioritization and Release Plan  In order to get a view of how to divide the requirements into different releases and what requirements should be included in which release, a prioritization of the requirements is needed. This section discusses the choice of prioritization methods and gives a suggestion of how the release plan for these requirements could look like. 4.1 Choice of prioritization method  When prioritizing the requirements the ten most important ones were picked out first. This was done with a simple “1 to 10” ranking method, with one being “not important” and ten “very important”. Based on the elicitation meetings, and the perceived ideas of what was important to the different stakeholders, a number was set for each requirement. The numbers were then summed up for each requirement and the ten with the highest score were chosen to be prioritized with the cost value approach. The results, which are red-marked, can be seen in Appendix I and as shown, it turned out to be five functional requirements and five quality requirements. These requirements were then prioritized according to the cost value approach and the results can be viewed under Appendix II. ',\n",

The administrator can manage the information for each restaurant as well as the options for both the mobile application users and the restaurant owners. 2.4 Constraints  The mobile application is constrained by the system interface to the GPS navigation system within the mobile phone. Since there are multiple system and multiple GPS manufacturers, the interface will most likely not be the same for every one of them. Also, there may be a difference between what navigation features each of them provide.  The Internet connection is also a constraint for the application. Since the application fetches data from the database over the Internet, it is crucial that there is an Internet connection for the application to function. ',\n",

Introduction  TCI Ferry (aka Caribbean Cruisin’) operates passenger ferries (no vehicles) between the islands that make up the Turks & Caicos Islands in the Caribbean. This document outlines the high-level functionality that is desired for a new Ticketing System for TCI Ferry. The system will consist of a centralized database, along with several Ticketing terminals in various locations. Connectivity between terminals and the database server will be via the internet. We anticipate having a full time “live connection” at each location, and we do not anticipate the need for “batch” processing. 1.1 Functionality Overview  - Sell tickets for trips on specific dates and times ',\n",

In addition, such changes will take into account any tickets sold/reserved for the Leg, and prevent the lowering of capacities below these numbers.

This could be due to poor weather, or mechanical failure, or any other reason. The decision to “storm a Leg” can be made at any moment prior to the vessel departing, even if all passengers have already boarded. The manager selects a specific Leg (using a radio button) in the Leg Status screen, then clicks the Storm Leg button. After confirming this choice, the system will mark the status of this Leg as “Storm”. This Leg will still appear in the Leg Status screen, but will be identified by colour and/or message. This Leg will no longer be visible in the Ticketing screen except as is required to move a ticket from this leg to another. A record will be created/updated in the Leg database table to indicate the Leg has been stormed. Note: This function will prevent any further tickets from being sold on this leg. Tickets already sold will not be cancelled, and any user can move a purchased ticket from this leg to another without penalty to the passenger. In other words, a ticket on a “stormed” leg can be exchanged at full value for another ticket, even after the scheduled sailing date.

Any high-level requirements mentioned elsewhere are assumed to inherit priorities of their detailed counterparts in section 4,5.  1.2.2 Fonts Conventions Throughout this document, All the user entities are written in capitalizations i.e. first letter as capital. Also, any significant term which has been described in the glossary is made bold and italic in the text. On the other hand, those terms which are significant (but not described in glossary) are bold in text. 1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions The purpose of this document is to give a detailed description of the requirements for the “DineOut” software. It will illustrate the purpose, scope and complete description for the development of system. It will also explain external interface requirements and system requirements as well as non-functional requirements. This document is primarily intended to be proposed to a customer for its approval and also for further processing such as additions to be developed in later releases. Customers can refer to section 3 and 4 for the list of requirements implemented in Version 1.0. Users are advised to refer to user documentation section for tutorials and online support information. This document will also be used as a reference for developing and testing Version 1.0 by the development team as well as the testers. The development team can refer to section 2.3 and 2.6 for system level information and section 3 for system features that are to be implemented in this version of the software. Software Requirements Specification for DineOut Page 2 1.4 Product Scope DineOut is a restaurant management system developed with the intention of automating the day to day tasks in a restaurant like order and inventory management, bill generation and taking feedback. This release of the software would deal with these tasks only whereas more areas might be automated in the future versions of this software. The main purpose is to improve the performance of the restaurant by eradicating the daily paperwork. With this system the tasks would be performed in less amount of time and more efficiently. An additional benefit of this software is that during the rush hours the load can be balanced effectively, and restaurants would perform better than usual. In addition to this, human error that occurs when performing tasks manually is also minimized and presence of queues in the system to assign tasks to chefs can reduce congestion in the kitchen. The system would also result in reduction of labor which would result in the reduction of expenses of the restaurant. Feedback module would help the restaurant check for how well they are performing, and monthly/yearly figures can be checked by the billing module to see the trends in sales and profits. These benefits can potentially result in generation of more revenues for the restaurant. 1.5 References 1.

Overall Description This section will give an overview of the DineOut application. The basic functionality of the system as well its context will be explored in detail. It also describes different kinds of stakeholders and user classes associated with the system and what functionality is available for each class. At last, the assumptions and dependencies for the system are presented. 2.1 Product Perspective DineOut app will attempt to replace the traditional manual ordering process and is a new self- contained software system that consists of two parts: one mobile application and the other is Firebase database. The mobile application will be used for ordering and interacting with the inventory while the Firebase database will be used for storing the inventory and ordering related information about the food items like pending and complete order queues. The mobile application will have five interfaces. Each for Customer, Manager, Head Chef, Admin and Chef. Manager can see/edit the status of available/reserved tables. Customer’s interface will consist of a scrollable menu listing available items and their price. When the customer selects some dishes and place the order, it will be stored in “pending orders” table in Firebase database. Head Chef’s interface will be such that he is notified of the pending order and he is able to assign it to one the available queues of chefs who are then able to see the new order in their screens or on a central display in kitchen. After each item/dish in an order is prepared, the order is marked completed through the Head Chef’s interface, the hall manager gets notified through his interface. Customer’s interface has an option for requesting the bill. Bill is printed through the Manager’s interface. Admin can change and modify the Firebase database like add new menus or staff, edit current inventory stock etc. Fig1 - System Perspective Diagram Software Requirements Specification for DineOut Page 4 2.2 Product Functions Given below are the major functions that can be performed using DineOut app. Moreover, a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for better understanding of the system is also given in Appendix B. The system will: • Allow Customers to scroll through the menu and select the dishes he/she wants. • Allow the Customers to cancel/edit the order any time before its prepared. • Allow Customers to provide feedback regarding the food and overall service of the restaurant. • Allow Customers to request for bill. • Allow Customers to ask for help through the system. • Assign Head Chef to assign the dishes in an order to chefs according to their specialties. • Show dish queues and their status, for Chefs. • Allow admin to perform CRUD (create, retrieve, update and delete) operations on Staff Members, Menu Items and Inventory. • Allow Head Chef to mark orders complete. • Allow the Head Chef to approve cancellation of dish or order. • Allow Hall Manager to mark the bill as paid. • Notify the Hall Manager when a particular order is complete. • Allow the Hall Manager to see/edit status of tables reserved and available and their capacities. 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics There are four types of users that interact with our system (See appendix B). Firstly, there is a Hall Manager, then Customer, Head Chef and Admin. We’ll provide an interface for Chefs as well through which they are looking at the status of their order queues, but they will not interact with our system. System shall use v4 support library Print Helper for connecting to the printer and  a driver to connect to the kitchen screen. 3.4 Communications Interfaces DineOut is an android application and it will communicate with Firebase (which is a storage server provided by Google for android developers). Firebase uses HTTP protocol for communication, so our device will follow HTTP protocol when connecting to Firebase. Software Requirements Specification for DineOut Page 9 4. System Requirements 4.1 Place Order  4.1.1 Description and Priority 2.3.5 Hall Manager Hall Managers will provide its input when he marks the bill as paid when customers pay for their order or get the bill printed. Moreover, he gets a notification whenever a particular order is complete, or some customer asks for help through the system. Hall manager can also see tables in the hall and their status i.e. empty or filled. 2.4 Operating Environment It is an android application running on a tablet and the tablets are present in a restaurant. Firstly, manager would be present at the entrance and system in his tab would show the tables that are empty/reserved. There would be a tab present at every table for customers which they will use to give order. When an order is placed the server would notify the head chef/ kitchen manager who would be in the kitchen. Head chef would use his tab which also would have the system installed and would add the order to the appropriate queues of the chefs. The chefs would be present in the kitchen area and their interface would allow them to check for the dishes they have to prepare. So, the system is running on various tablets but the operating environment and purpose of each is different for each user. 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints  2.5.1 Operating System Constraint  System should be compatible and will smoothly run on Android version 6.0 or above. 2.3.4 Admin Admin’s job is to manage the inventory and other information related to menu and chefs in the system.  2.3.5 Hall Manager Hall Managers will provide its input when he marks the bill as paid when customers pay for their order or get the bill printed. Moreover, he gets a notification whenever a particular order is complete, or some customer asks for help through the system. Hall manager can also see tables in the hall and their status i.e. empty or filled. 2.4 Operating Environment It is an android application running on a tablet and the tablets are present in a restaurant.

Introduction 1.1 Purpose DineOut is an android application that aims to digitalize the process of various restaurant management operations including ordering and inventory management and POS. This document aims to capture the system requirements and features particularly related to ordering and inventory management to be implemented in DineOut version 1.0., with the later releases on POS (Point of Sale). 1.2 Document Conventions  1.2.1 Priority Conventions In this complete document, we will mention priority as “low” or “high” throughout the document. Secondly, priorities are only mentioned in section 4 and section 5 along with detailed description of the requirements. Any high-level requirements mentioned elsewhere are assumed to inherit priorities of their detailed counterparts in section 4,5.  1.2.2 Fonts Conventions Throughout this document, All the user entities are written in capitalizations i.e. first letter as capital. Also, any significant term which has been described in the glossary is made bold and italic in the text. On the other hand, those terms which are significant (but not described in glossary) are bold in text. 1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions The purpose of this document is to give a detailed description of the requirements for the “DineOut” software. It will illustrate the purpose, scope and complete description for the development of system. It will also explain external interface requirements and system requirements as well as non-functional requirements. This document is primarily intended to be proposed to a customer for its approval and also for further processing such as additions to be developed in later releases. Customers can refer to section 3 and 4 for the list of requirements implemented in Version 1.0. Users are advised to refer to user documentation section for tutorials and online support information. This document will also be used as a reference for developing and testing Version 1.0 by the development team as well as the testers. The development team can refer to section 2.3 and 2.6 for system level information and section 3 for system features that are to be implemented in this version of the software. Software Requirements Specification for DineOut Page 2 1.4 Product Scope DineOut is a restaurant management system developed with the intention of automating the day to day tasks in a restaurant like order and inventory management, bill generation and taking feedback. This release of the software would deal with these tasks only whereas more areas might be automated in the future versions of this software. The main purpose is to improve the performance of the restaurant by eradicating the daily paperwork. With this system the tasks would be performed in less amount of time and more efficiently. An additional benefit of this software is that during the rush hours the load can be balanced effectively, and restaurants would perform better than usual. In addition to this, human error that occurs when performing tasks manually is also minimized and presence of queues in the system to assign tasks to chefs can reduce congestion in the kitchen. The system would also result in reduction of labor which would result in the reduction of expenses of the restaurant. Feedback module would help the restaurant check for how well they are performing, and monthly/yearly figures can be checked by the billing module to see the trends in sales and profits. These benefits can potentially result in generation of more revenues for the restaurant. 1.5 References 1.

Overall Description This section will give an overview of the DineOut application. The basic functionality of the system as well its context will be explored in detail. It also describes different kinds of stakeholders and user classes associated with the system and what functionality is available for each class. At last, the assumptions and dependencies for the system are presented. 2.1 Product Perspective DineOut app will attempt to replace the traditional manual ordering process and is a new self- contained software system that consists of two parts: one mobile application and the other is Firebase database. The mobile application will be used for ordering and interacting with the inventory while the Firebase database will be used for storing the inventory and ordering related information about the food items like pending and complete order queues. The mobile application will have five interfaces. Each for Customer, Manager, Head Chef, Admin and Chef. Manager can see/edit the status of available/reserved tables. Customer’s interface will consist of a scrollable menu listing available items and their price. When the customer selects some dishes and place the order, it will be stored in “pending orders” table in Firebase database. Head Chef’s interface will be such that he is notified of the pending order and he is able to assign it to one the available queues of chefs who are then able to see the new order in their screens or on a central display in kitchen. After each item/dish in an order is prepared, the order is marked completed through the Head Chef’s interface, the hall manager gets notified through his interface. Customer’s interface has an option for requesting the bill. Bill is printed through the Manager’s interface. Admin can change and modify the Firebase database like add new menus or staff, edit current inventory stock etc. Fig1 - System Perspective Diagram Software Requirements Specification for DineOut Page 4 2.2 Product Functions Given below are the major functions that can be performed using DineOut app. Moreover, a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for better understanding of the system is also given in Appendix B. The system will: • Allow Customers to scroll through the menu and select the dishes he/she wants. • Allow the Customers to cancel/edit the order any time before its prepared. • Allow Customers to provide feedback regarding the food and overall service of the restaurant. • Allow Customers to request for bill. • Allow Customers to ask for help through the system. • Assign Head Chef to assign the dishes in an order to chefs according to their specialties. • Show dish queues and their status, for Chefs. • Allow admin to perform CRUD (create, retrieve, update and delete) operations on Staff Members, Menu Items and Inventory. • Allow Head Chef to mark orders complete. • Allow the Head Chef to approve cancellation of dish or order. • Allow Hall Manager to mark the bill as paid. • Notify the Hall Manager when a particular order is complete. • Allow the Hall Manager to see/edit status of tables reserved and available and their capacities. 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics There are four types of users that interact with our system (See appendix B). Firstly, there is a Hall Manager, then Customer, Head Chef and Admin. We’ll provide an interface for Chefs as well through which they are looking at the status of their order queues, but they will not interact with our system. 1.2.1 Priority Conventions In this complete document, we will mention priority as “low” or “high” throughout the document.

As such, it is beyond the scope of this system to encrypt personal user data, encrypt credit card information, prevent unauthorized login attempts, or any other concern of this nature. Additionally, the system is not responsible for the following: Defining and describing the functions and specifications of the Book E-Commerce System (BECS) is the primary goal of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS). This Software Requirements Specification illustrates, in clear terms, the system’s primary uses and required functionality as specified by our customer. The intended audience of this document is our primary Book E-Commerce System customer: Mr. Borzoo Bonakdarpour, the CSE435 instructor Dr. Betty Cheng, the fall semester 2007 CSE435 Group 4 members, as well as the other students attending CSE435 that will require access to such documentation. Template based on IEEE Std 830-1998 for SRS. Modifications (content and ordering of information) have been made by Betty H.C. Cheng, Michigan State University (chengb at chengb.cse.msu.edu) 1.2 Scope  The software system being produced is called Book E-Commerce System or BECS. It is being produced for a customer interested in selling books via the Internet. This system is designed to “provide automation support” [2] for the process of placing books for sale on the Internet and facilitating the actual sale. This system is largely cross-platform and is available to anyone using the Computer Science Department’s provided computer resources in the MSU Engineering Building. The system will be run on a central server with each user having a remote user interface through a web browser to interact with it. The Book E-Commerce System will allow any user to create an account to become a customer. The customer, through the process of account creation, will have the option to become a member of the site. The system will allow customers to browse, search, select, and add books to a shopping cart. Then, provided they have books in their shopping cart, check out books in shopping cart and decrement the stock that the inventory the system maintains. The BECS also allows a manager to manage the inventory with full create, retrieve, update and delete (CRUD) functionality with regards to books in the system. It will also allow, on an inventory wide basis, customers and managers to interact with a promotion system that handles percentage-off promotions that can be applied to member’s orders. This interaction includes the creation (by managers) and the application to orders (by customers) of the promotions. The BECS has full email capabilities; the automated email functionality will be used to send promotions to members of the system as well as provide the managers with low-stock notifications. The BECS will have numerous constraints on what it can do. The system will not have full credit-card processing capabilities. It will not allow managers to be customers. The manager will be a hard-coded user and only a single manager will exist. There will be no actual book ordering and order completion, however the system will provide the customer with a receipt and it will log the transaction details. The system will not allow multiple promotions to be added to a single shopping cart nor will it allow a customer to add more than one of each item to their cart. The system also will not allow users to retrieve passwords or edit their user details. 1.3 Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations BECS  Book E-Commerce System Barcode Additionally, the system may need to later be extended to provide additional functions. Additionally, the system may need to later be extended to provide additional functions. One such example is added support for visually impaired users. In many cases a screen- reading program is used and ensuring that page-layout reads from top-left to bottom-right in a logical manner would be required. 3 Specific Requirements 1. Restrictions 1.1.

Actors The Software Requirements Specification is designed to document and describe the agreement between the customer and the developer regarding the specification of the software product requested [5]. Its primary purpose is to provide a clear and descriptive “statement of user requirements” [5] that can be used as a reference in further development of the software system. This document is broken into a number of sections used to logically separate the software requirements into easily referenced parts. This Software Requirements Specification aims to describe the Functionality, External Interfaces, Attributes and Design Constraints [4] imposed on Implementation of the software system described throughout the rest of the document. Throughout the description of the software system, the language and terminology used should unambiguous and consistent throughout the document. 1.1 Purpose  Defining and describing the functions and specifications of the Book E-Commerce System (BECS) is the primary goal of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS). This Software Requirements Specification illustrates, in clear terms, the system’s primary uses and required functionality as specified by our customer. The intended audience of this document is our primary Book E-Commerce System customer: Mr. Borzoo Bonakdarpour, the CSE435 instructor Dr. Betty Cheng, the fall semester 2007 CSE435 Group 4 members, as well as the other students attending CSE435 that will require access to such documentation. Template based on IEEE Std 830-1998 for SRS. Modifications (content and ordering of information) have been made by Betty H.C. Cheng, Michigan State University (chengb at chengb.cse.msu.edu) 1.2 Scope  The software system being produced is called Book E-Commerce System or BECS. It is being produced for a customer interested in selling books via the Internet. This system is designed to “provide automation support” [2] for the process of placing books for sale on the Internet and facilitating the actual sale. This system is largely cross-platform and is available to anyone using the Computer Science Department’s provided computer resources in the MSU Engineering Building. The system will be run on a central server with each user having a remote user interface through a web browser to interact with it. The Book E-Commerce System will allow any user to create an account to become a customer. The customer, through the process of account creation, will have the option to become a member of the site. The system will allow customers to browse, search, select, and add books to a shopping cart. Then, provided they have books in their shopping cart, check out books in shopping cart and decrement the stock that the inventory the system maintains. The BECS also allows a manager to manage the inventory with full create, retrieve, update and delete (CRUD) functionality with regards to books in the system. It will also allow, on an inventory wide basis, customers and managers to interact with a promotion system that handles percentage-off promotions that can be applied to member’s orders. This interaction includes the creation (by managers) and the application to orders (by customers) of the promotions. The BECS has full email capabilities; the automated email functionality will be used to send promotions to members of the system as well as provide the managers with low-stock notifications. The BECS will have numerous constraints on what it can do. The system will not have full credit-card processing capabilities. It will not allow managers to be customers. The manager will be a hard-coded user and only a single manager will exist. There will be no actual book ordering and order completion, however the system will provide the customer with a receipt and it will log the transaction details. The system will not allow multiple promotions to be added to a single shopping cart nor will it allow a customer to add more than one of each item to their cart. The system also will not allow users to retrieve passwords or edit their user details. 1.3 Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations BECS ',\n",

The first section includes explanations of the Purpose, Scope and Organization of the document. The first section also handles the description of project- specific words, acronyms and abbreviations that will be used in the document. The second section of the document is separated into the following five different sections, each detailing specific details of system uses and their corresponding actions: Product Perspective, Product Functions, User Characteristics, Constraints, Assumptions and Dependencies, Apportioning of Requirements. The third section is an enumerated listing of all of the requirements described for this system. The fourth section encompasses all of the Use-case, Sequence, State and Class diagrams that model the system. In the fifth section there exists a Prototype of the system along with a sample scenario that graphically describes the use of the system. The sixth section contains a listing of all related reference materials used in this document. The seventh and final subsection is dedicated to providing a point of contact for any viewer of this document. 2 Overall Description An object that lists a Customer\\'s selected Items, their applied promotions and gives them an option to check out SRS  Software Requirements Specification Stock  The quantity of any particular item the inventory has on hand Text Box The typical BECS user is simply anyone that has access to the Internet and a web browser in the computer science department at Michigan State University. It is assumed that the user is familiar enough with a computer to operate the browser, keyboard and mouse and is capable of browsing to, from and within simple websites [1]. 2.4 Constraints  As stated by the customer, security is not a concern for this system. The database may store passwords in plain text and there doesn\\'t need to be a password recovery feature nor lockout after numerous invalid login attempts. As such, the system may not work correctly in cases when security is a concern. These cases include those listed above in addition to lack of an encrypted connection when sending credit card information and forcing users to use “strong” passwords. A strong password is a password that meets a number of conditions that are set in place so that user\\'s passwords cannot be easily guessed by an attacker. Generally, these rules include ensuring that the password contains a sufficient number of characters and contains not only lowercase letters but also capitals, numbers, and in some cases, symbols. The system may not behave correctly when used with Internet browsers other than Firefox and Internet Explorer.

       "  'What are the requirements functional non functional': 'The testing of a software product should include four components. These are 1. Functional coverage, 2. Topological coverage, 3. Component interface, 4. Performance measures. Functional coverage refers to how many of the code processes and data (if applicable) are exercised during the testing. An example of a process is the editing and retrieval features built into the Document Database. Data refers to the pieces of information stored, retrieved, and manipulated by the software. Topological coverage refers to the logic path that the code takes to determines if a particular function, task, or feature is executed. For example, the logic path the code may take to allow record retrieval may involve first checking the user identification and then checking if the record exists. Component interface refers to how well each of the code components or modules work together as a whole. Each module or component may work fine independently. Testing the component interface verifies that the code logic linking each component operates correctly. Performance measures refer to measures that quantitatively describe how well the code performed during testing. In this test plan, we have attempted to address all four of these components by designating a test database that will include entries in all data entities and data fields, and testing all code features that have been written and implemented. Neither functional or topological coverage is 100% assured, but through the methods outlined in this test plan, we can be reasonably assured that most situations a user may encounter during normal operation of the code are tested. The software tested will be designated the Beta Test Version until successful completion of the testing procedures.  Evaluation of Materials Released from SRS Software Quality Assurance I2-3 FEATURES TO BE TESTED  User interface application modules are written under the Visual Foxpro object-oriented programming language. The user is presented a series of menu items that perform specific tasks. These items have methods and properties attached to them and it is these features that will be tested, along with the relational integrity of the data tables that are linked to their operation. A main menu is presented first and includes the items typically found on most Windows -based applications. Under each main menu item is a series of submenus that exercises different options, depending on the needs of the user. The main menu items shown in Figure I2-1 will be tested. The referential integrity of each table will also be tested as stated in the software requirements and design specifications document ( Rood et al. 1996 ). APPROACH This test plan for the Document Database will accomplish the following objectives: • Detail the activities required to prepare for and conduct the software test, • Communicate to all responsible parties the tasks that they are to perform and the schedule to be followed when performing the tasks, • Define the sources of information used to prepare the plan, and • Define the operating environment needed to conduct the test. SCOPE  This test plan covers the testing of the Document Database software by independent reviewers. The developers may also use the procedures defined in this document for internal testing before release. The testing will cover referential integrity of the tables and the application software designed to manage and control input, output, and editing of the tables.

Documentation should include all test results and any abnormalities noted by the test analyst. This documentation should be saved by the test analyst. If during the testing procedure a portion of the code does not operate correctly and makes continued testing impossible, then the test analyst will notify the software developer of the problem immediately. The software developer will make the necessary corrections and re-issue a new version of the software. The new software will be designated Beta Test Version 1.1 for the first occurrence and 1.2, 1.3 etc. for any future occurrences. All testing done prior to the occurrence will be redone using the new the software to assure corrections did not impact other subroutines in the software. The test report should not include recommendations for improvements to the code. However, these may be requested separately. The report should include results from each of the tests identified in this document. All tests should be performed using the same Beta Test Version number. After the software developer receives verbal test results, appropriate corrections to the software will be made, and the software will then be released to the CDC, identifying it as Version 1.0. OPERATING ENVIRONMENT FOR TESTING  The software will use the Foxpro relational database language and will require a microcomputer operating under MS DOS \\uf8e9 , Version 6.0 or higher, Windows Version 3.1 or higher, and at least 8MB of extended random access memory although 16MB is preferable.

       "  'Who are the users or audience': 'RAC RAC reports are correctly listed in the database; 3) cross references between RAC reports and source documents are correct; and 4) source document authors are listed correctly. HOST SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS  The document database software will use the Foxpro \\uf8e9 relational database language and will require a microcomputer operating under MS DOS \\uf8e9 , Version 6.0 or higher, Windows \\uf8e9 Version 3.1 or higher, and at least 8MB of extended random access memory, although 16MB is preferable. About 200MB of free hard disk space will be required to load and operate the software. GENERAL USER INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS  The software will provide a user interface to allow a trained nondeveloper to add, subtract, edit, or query fields in the database. The user interface will be written in the Visual Foxpro programming language. The user will be presented with a typical Windows based interface menu. Under each main menu item, the user will be able to select options such as data entry and report generation. The current menu options are shown in Figure I1-1 . Typically, opening, closing, saving, and exiting a Windows application is accomplished through the file menu option. However, this software does not include open, close, and save menu options because the database files will automatically be opened or saved when opening or exiting the application. The Edit menu contains the typical Windows options such as Cut , Copy , Paste , and Select . The core of the application is the Data Entry menu ( Figure I1-1 ). The user may search for records and view their contents, add records, delete records, and print selected records. Records can be retrieved, added, deleted, edited, or printed. There are four areas of data entry: 1. Those that refer to SRS Environmental Dose Reconstruction discovery documents ( Documents ), 2. Those that contain information of persons involved in the dose reconstruction ( Personnel ), 3. Those that describe documents created for Phase II of the SRS Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project ( Project Reports ), and 4. Those that describe interviews that have been conducted ( Interviews ). Printed reports can be obtained from the Reports menu. Reports may be printed for all the categories listed under the Data Entry menu. The Utilities menu offers options to export data to other databases via the DBS format, or export the data for use in a Geographical Information System (GIS). The Utilities menu also allows access to tables so the lookup table can be updated throughout the life of the project.

User interface menus for the Document Database. The Documents submenu under the Data Entry menu refers to documents found during document searches. Project Reports refers to reports generated during Phase II of the SRS Dose Reconstruction Project. The GIS designation under the Utilities menu refers to a Geographical Information System. DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS  The software will use the Visual Foxpro relational database software and programming language. Foxpro databases (designated with the .DBC extension) are composed of tables that are designated with a .DBF file extension. Tables will be created for each data entity . Each entity may contain numerous data fields . A field contains the information that is either entered or retrieved by the user, or defined based on a logical expression. A field is designated as a character field, numeric field, date field, logical field, or memo field. Character, date, memo, and numeric fields have lengths defined by the developer. That is, the field has a limited number of characters that may be entered in the field by the end-user. Logical fields have a predefined length of 1. Tables are usually linked to other tables by fields of the same name and data type and length. In this way, the information presented to the end-user may originate from several tables that are related by fields of the same type and length. The user interface will access the tables to enter data, edit existing data, query existing data, and generate reports. The program will be compiled into an executable file for distribution to end- users. Figure I1-1. User interface menus for the Document Database.

The user interface will be written in the Visual Foxpro programming language. The user will be presented with a typical Windows based interface menu. Under each main menu item, the user will be able to select options such as data entry and report generation. The current menu options are shown in Figure I1-1 . Typically, opening, closing, saving, and exiting a Windows application is accomplished through the file menu option. However, this software does not include open, close, and save menu options because the database files will automatically be opened or saved when opening or exiting the application. The Edit menu contains the typical Windows options such as Cut , Copy , Paste , and Select . The core of the application is the Data Entry menu ( Figure I1-1 ). The user may search for records and view their contents, add records, delete records, and print selected records. Records can be retrieved, added, deleted, edited, or printed. There are four areas of data entry: 1. Those that refer to SRS Environmental Dose Reconstruction discovery documents ( Documents ), 2. Those that contain information of persons involved in the dose reconstruction ( Personnel ), 3. Those that describe documents created for Phase II of the SRS Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project ( Project Reports ), and 4. Those that describe interviews that have been conducted ( Interviews ). Printed reports can be obtained from the Reports menu. Reports may be printed for all the categories listed under the Data Entry menu. The Utilities menu offers options to export data to other databases via the DBS format, or export the data for use in a Geographical Information System (GIS). The Utilities menu also allows access to tables so the lookup table can be updated throughout the life of the project.

The Save As button saves a copy of the project under a different project name. Clicking the Save As button opens a dialog prompting the user for a new project name (Figure 20). This workflow is described in Figure 21. WAVED is a graphical, interactive, integrated development environment. The development environment runs within a web browser, using a keyboard and pointing device for input. Upon navigating to the web address of the WAVED application, users are presented with a welcome dialog with two options: Create a New Project or Load a Project (Figure 1). If the user selects to create a new project, they are prompted to enter a name for the project and are presented with a blank project (Figure 3). If the user selects to load an existing project, he or she is presented with a list of previously saved project names from which to pick. All possible methods for creating a project within WAVED are shown in the activity diagram in Figure 3.  Figure 1 Figure 1 . The welcome splash screen  10 ',\n",

Introduction 2.1 Purpose  This document provides the requirement specifications for Web App for Visualizing Environmental Data (WAVED). It specifies user interface attributes, functional and nonfunctional requirements, and long- term ideas for the evolution of the system. 2.2 Overview  Climate Central performs scientific research to collect multi-coordinate data on climate change. The company creates interactive maps and other graphics to present this data on their website for public consumption. For example, one such demonstration colors each state in the United States based on its recorded change in temperature. Clicking on a state displays a line graph showing the temperature data for that particular state. Currently, Climate Central develops each interactive visualization from scratch. This process is time and labor intensive and does not provide any mechanism for reusing common elements across visualizations. 44 6. System Evolution  To narrow the scope of initial development, the current requirements are based on two expectations. The first expectation is that only a few widgets are needed to support Climate Central's immediate use cases. The second expectation is that WAVED is not public facing, but rather a tool used on an internal network, so an open permissions model suffices. As the system evolves, changes to WAVED adds functionality beyond these assumptions. 6.1 New Widgets  Future modifications to the system include expanding the set of available widgets by implementing new plugins. New widgets may include: • Vector maps of geographic areas other than the United States • Widgets using third party mapping APIs such as Google Maps, Leaflet, Cesium, etc. • Different types of graphs (e.g. bar graph, pie chart, etc.) 6.2 User Permissions \",\n",

       "  'What is the scope': \"6 Introduction The NPT is a community, open source project. Purpose The present Nodes Portal Toolkit (NPT) Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document was prepared as the next incremental step after the NPT Scoping and Requirements (S&R) document , which was drafted by the NPT Advisory Group (AG), during the Madrid workshop in March 2011 and publicly released in June 2011. The purpose of the SRS is to describe the software requirements for the NPT, reaching a level of detail which makes it fit to be circulated amongst the NPT stakeholders, and in particular amongst the NPT developers. It is also intended to serve as a basis for discussion during the Brussels NPT technical meeting (September 2011), during which elements for a high-level architectural and design document will be gathered. The purpose of the current version of the SRS document is to clarify, validate and verify the requirements for the NPT as expressed by the NPT-AG, focusing on its functional aspects. The SRS captures and describes the desired behavior of the end product in a wide range of situations. Some of the non-functional requirements in this document were taken as is from the scoping document and can still be refined. The present document is also intended to be a planning instrument for the The present document is also intended to be a planning instrument for the development of the NPT and its potential derivatives. Scope of the NPT As described in the NPT (S&R) document , the Nodes Portal Toolkit is a tool to facilitate discovery and access to GBIF data at a national, regional or thematic level, including the possibility to offer access to additional sources of information. The primary users of the NPT are the Node Managers (specifically, the technical teams involved in GBIF Participant Nodes and/or relevant biodiversity information networks), as well as the End-Users of the data published through the various NPT instances. The NPT should enable the Node Managers to customize the way GBIF-compliant data are served to their own community or to a specific group of data users. Development of the NPT is based on the needs expressed by the Nodes community. To the best extent possible, the wishes of the Nodes and their communities regarding NPT functionalities will be expressed in the flexibility and scalability of the tool itself. Commitment and feedback is expected from the Nodes community in order to align their needs and the functionalities of the NPT, as it evolves in its various releases. Even if the NPT is intended to be a technical tool, NPT-based portals are also envisioned as an important public relations and communication tool for GBIF Participant Nodes, serving also to demonstrate the possibilities that the GBIF network offers at different levels (national, regional, thematic). 7 Product perspective and historical background The need for GBIF Participant Node data portals distinct from (and interacting with) the GBIF central portal was already recognized at the first meeting of the Nodes committee in Oct 2002 in San Juan, Costa Rica as a major component of the overall GBIF architecture. This quickly led to the release of a first version of a GBIF Portal toolkit for Nodes (Dec 2002). As there were still no GBIF-mediated data to share at that time, this early portal was mainly a communication tool (featuring a hierarchical directory of links, files and html pages, announcements, news and articles, calendar of events, news channels syndication, etc.…). It also featured a repository for biodiversity data files exported from databases (prefiguring to some degree the approach adopted by the current IPT software in which exported Darwin Core Archives are used to facilitate indexing). Nodes started to deploy the GBIF DiGIR network to publish species occurrence data in the fall of 2004 (BioCASE sites following shortly after). A first prototype GBIF central portal was officially launched in February 2004. In April 2004, Nodes recommended to consider the development of a data portal toolkit for nodes as part of a work program. In October 2004, the recommendation became a ranked priority, second only to hiring a full time Nodes officer. Between May and October 2005, a draft requirements document was developed, a workshop was held in Copenhagen and some resources were allocated to an early prototype presented in April 2006 in South Africa. At that time, the customized portal for nodes was pretty much perceived as a national or thematic subset of the central portal. Subsequently the secretariat focused on the development of a new central portal and the prototype custom portal for nodes was never deployed. In the summer of 2009, an online survey was conducted with preliminary results presented at the Nodes meeting in Copenhagen in October. This led to convening an Advisory Group (AG) in December 2009 in Montreal to work on a scoping document for a Nodes Portal Toolkit (NPT) and a set of recommendations on how to develop, implement and deploy such a toolkit. The AG met again in March 2011 in Madrid and prepared the scoping (S&R) document, under the supervision of the NPT Coordinator. After revision and consultation loops between the NPT AG, the GBIF secretariat and the NPT-Coordinator, the S&R document was publicly released in June 2011. Document conventions The main type of convention used throughout this document helps to represent the level of priority of the different software requirements. These priorities are established in function of many factors, including those identified in the NPT (S&R) document , consultation loops with the NPT stakeholders, and technical constraints which represent the reality at the moment this document is prepared. In the functional requirements section, to keep consistency with the NPT (S&R) document , the same color codes define priorities as defined by the MoSCoW method . Green: NPT V1.0 must have this feature Green: NPT V1.0 must have this feature Yellow: NPT V1.0 should have this feature if at all possible Red: NPT V1.0 could have this feature (if it doesn't affect anything else) Black: NPT V1.0 won't have this feature (maybe in the future) 8 In Use Case surveys , and Use Case sections, priorities and frequency are attributed an increasing index, ranging from 1 (low priority/frequency) to 5 (high priority/frequency). In the nonfunctional requirements section , a series of acronyms are used, as described below: BR = Business Rules CO = Design and Implementation Constraints CR = Capacity Requirements IR = Interoperability Requirements OE = Operating Environment RR = Robustness Requirements ScaR = Scalability Requirements SR = Security Requirements SupR = Supportability Requirements UD = User Documentation UR = Usability Requirements 9 Actor Survey This section lists the different actors NPT instances shall interact with: end users (primary actors) and actors from which the system needs assistance to satisfy a goal (secondary actors).

RR2 Database transactions shall insure data consistency in case of failure. RR3 Backups of all system data shall be generated on a weekly basis. RR4 Upon request from the data manager, a backup shall be restored within the next 24 hours. Interoperability Requirements IR1 The system shall allow importing checklist resources as DwC-A files. IR2 The system shall allow importing occurrence resources as DwC-A files. IR3 The system shall allow exporting checklist resources as DwC-A files. IR4 The system shall allow exporting occurrence records as DwC-A files. IR5 The system shall allow exporting occurrences records as KMZ files. IR6 The system shall allow exporting occurrences records as CSV files. IR7 The system shall allow exporting occurrences records as ESRI shapefiles. IR8 The system shall allow exporting distribution map as images. IR9 The system shall allow exporting core resource metadata as EML profiles. IR10 The system shall allow using the Audubon Core format for multimedia metadata. Operating Environment OE1 The system shall operate with the two latest major releases of the following Web browsers: Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Internet Explorer and Safari. OE2 The system shall operate on a server running Linux, Windows server or Mac OS. Usability Requirements UR1 The interface for end-users should be relatively intuitive and easy to use, without requiring extensive technical assistance, support or off line user guides. UR2 For system managers, guides may be needed to explore advanced functionalities, but those advanced functionalities should be as intuitive as possible. UR3 Maintenance in terms of user interface configuration, user rights management, and data source settings should be done with visual tools. UR4 The system shall allow a visitor to select the language used on the front end. UR5 The system shall display friendly error messages to the users. Supportability Requirements SupR1 A clear and standard practice for the maintenance and documentation of code should be set in place, agreed and communicated as a best practice. Any features developed outside the core of the NPT should follow that practice. User Documentation Requirements UD1 The system shall provide a short tutorial video explaining how to search and export occurrence records. UD2 One offline installation guide with step-by-step instructions shall be provided (with different notes for each OS the system can operate on). 28 UD3 A wiki, organized around the different types of users, on the NPT Google Code site, similar to that developed for the GBIF IPT project will be available. Design and Implementation Constraints CO1 The system shall be implemented using open-source technologies. CO2 The system shall be written in PHP. CO3 The system should be built in a modular way, which ensures that component functionalities can be adjusted, added, improved, removed or exchanged without impacting the application as a whole. Approaching the system using development best practices such as MVC (Model-View-Controller) can allow this sort of modularity. CO4 The NPT development and implementation should follow design principles that will enable future growth, both in terms of the addition of new functionality or through modification of existing functionality.

Purpose The present Nodes Portal Toolkit (NPT) Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document was prepared as the next incremental step after the NPT Scoping and Requirements (S&R) document , which was drafted by the NPT Advisory Group (AG), during the Madrid workshop in March 2011 and publicly released in June 2011. The purpose of the SRS is to describe the software requirements for the NPT, reaching a level of detail which makes it fit to be circulated amongst the NPT stakeholders, and in particular amongst the NPT developers. It is also intended to serve as a basis for discussion during the Brussels NPT technical meeting (September 2011), during which elements for a high-level architectural and design document will be gathered. The purpose of the current version of the SRS document is to clarify, validate and verify the requirements for the NPT as expressed by the NPT-AG, focusing on its functional aspects. The SRS captures and describes the desired behavior of the end product in a wide range of situations. Some of the non-functional requirements in this document were taken as is from the scoping document and can still be refined. The present document is also intended to be a planning instrument for the The present document is also intended to be a planning instrument for the development of the NPT and its potential derivatives. Scope of the NPT As described in the NPT (S&R) document , the Nodes Portal Toolkit is a tool to facilitate discovery and access to GBIF data at a national, regional or thematic level, including the possibility to offer access to additional sources of information. The primary users of the NPT are the Node Managers (specifically, the technical teams involved in GBIF Participant Nodes and/or relevant biodiversity information networks), as well as the End-Users of the data published through the various NPT instances. The NPT should enable the Node Managers to customize the way GBIF-compliant data are served to their own community or to a specific group of data users. Development of the NPT is based on the needs expressed by the Nodes community. To the best extent possible, the wishes of the Nodes and their communities regarding NPT functionalities will be expressed in the flexibility and scalability of the tool itself. Commitment and feedback is expected from the Nodes community in order to align their needs and the functionalities of the NPT, as it evolves in its various releases. Even if the NPT is intended to be a technical tool, NPT-based portals are also envisioned as an important public relations and communication tool for GBIF Participant Nodes, serving also to demonstrate the possibilities that the GBIF network offers at different levels (national, regional, thematic). 7 Product perspective and historical background The need for GBIF Participant Node data portals distinct from (and interacting with) the GBIF central portal was already recognized at the first meeting of the Nodes committee in Oct 2002 in San Juan, Costa Rica as a major component of the overall GBIF architecture. This quickly led to the release of a first version of a GBIF Portal toolkit for Nodes (Dec 2002). As there were still no GBIF-mediated data to share at that time, this early portal was mainly a communication tool (featuring a hierarchical directory of links, files and html pages, announcements, news and articles, calendar of events, news channels syndication, etc.…). It also featured a repository for biodiversity data files exported from databases (prefiguring to some degree the approach adopted by the current IPT software in which exported Darwin Core Archives are used to facilitate indexing). Nodes started to deploy the GBIF DiGIR network to publish species occurrence data in the fall of 2004 (BioCASE sites following shortly after). A first prototype GBIF central portal was officially launched in February 2004. In April 2004, Nodes recommended to consider the development of a data portal toolkit for nodes as part of a work program. In October 2004, the recommendation became a ranked priority, second only to hiring a full time Nodes officer. Between May and October 2005, a draft requirements document was developed, a workshop was held in Copenhagen and some resources were allocated to an early prototype presented in April 2006 in South Africa. At that time, the customized portal for nodes was pretty much perceived as a national or thematic subset of the central portal. Subsequently the secretariat focused on the development of a new central portal and the prototype custom portal for nodes was never deployed. In the summer of 2009, an online survey was conducted with preliminary results presented at the Nodes meeting in Copenhagen in October. This led to convening an Advisory Group (AG) in December 2009 in Montreal to work on a scoping document for a Nodes Portal Toolkit (NPT) and a set of recommendations on how to develop, implement and deploy such a toolkit. The AG met again in March 2011 in Madrid and prepared the scoping (S&R) document, under the supervision of the NPT Coordinator. After revision and consultation loops between the NPT AG, the GBIF secretariat and the NPT-Coordinator, the S&R document was publicly released in June 2011. Document conventions The main type of convention used throughout this document helps to represent the level of priority of the different software requirements. These priorities are established in function of many factors, including those identified in the NPT (S&R) document , consultation loops with the NPT stakeholders, and technical constraints which represent the reality at the moment this document is prepared. In the functional requirements section, to keep consistency with the NPT (S&R) document , the same color codes define priorities as defined by the MoSCoW method . Green: NPT V1.0 must have this feature Green: NPT V1.0 must have this feature Yellow: NPT V1.0 should have this feature if at all possible Red: NPT V1.0 could have this feature (if it doesn't affect anything else) Black: NPT V1.0 won't have this feature (maybe in the future) 8 In Use Case surveys , and Use Case sections, priorities and frequency are attributed an increasing index, ranging from 1 (low priority/frequency) to 5 (high priority/frequency). In the nonfunctional requirements section , a series of acronyms are used, as described below: BR = Business Rules CO = Design and Implementation Constraints CR = Capacity Requirements IR = Interoperability Requirements OE = Operating Environment RR = Robustness Requirements ScaR = Scalability Requirements SR = Security Requirements SupR = Supportability Requirements UD = User Documentation UR = Usability Requirements 9 Actor Survey This section lists the different actors NPT instances shall interact with: end users (primary actors) and actors from which the system needs assistance to satisfy a goal (secondary actors).

Purpose The present Nodes Portal Toolkit (NPT) Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document was prepared as the next incremental step after the NPT Scoping and Requirements (S&R) document , which was drafted by the NPT Advisory Group (AG), during the Madrid workshop in March 2011 and publicly released in June 2011. The purpose of the SRS is to describe the software requirements for the NPT, reaching a level of detail which makes it fit to be circulated amongst the NPT stakeholders, and in particular amongst the NPT developers. It is also intended to serve as a basis for discussion during the Brussels NPT technical meeting (September 2011), during which elements for a high-level architectural and design document will be gathered. The purpose of the current version of the SRS document is to clarify, validate and verify the requirements for the NPT as expressed by the NPT-AG, focusing on its functional aspects. The SRS captures and describes the desired behavior of the end product in a wide range of situations. Some of the non-functional requirements in this document were taken as is from the scoping document and can still be refined. The present document is also intended to be a planning instrument for the The present document is also intended to be a planning instrument for the development of the NPT and its potential derivatives. Scope of the NPT As described in the NPT (S&R) document , the Nodes Portal Toolkit is a tool to facilitate discovery and access to GBIF data at a national, regional or thematic level, including the possibility to offer access to additional sources of information. The primary users of the NPT are the Node Managers (specifically, the technical teams involved in GBIF Participant Nodes and/or relevant biodiversity information networks), as well as the End-Users of the data published through the various NPT instances. The NPT should enable the Node Managers to customize the way GBIF-compliant data are served to their own community or to a specific group of data users. Development of the NPT is based on the needs expressed by the Nodes community. To the best extent possible, the wishes of the Nodes and their communities regarding NPT functionalities will be expressed in the flexibility and scalability of the tool itself. Commitment and feedback is expected from the Nodes community in order to align their needs and the functionalities of the NPT, as it evolves in its various releases. Even if the NPT is intended to be a technical tool, NPT-based portals are also envisioned as an important public relations and communication tool for GBIF Participant Nodes, serving also to demonstrate the possibilities that the GBIF network offers at different levels (national, regional, thematic). 7 Product perspective and historical background The need for GBIF Participant Node data portals distinct from (and interacting with) the GBIF central portal was already recognized at the first meeting of the Nodes committee in Oct 2002 in San Juan, Costa Rica as a major component of the overall GBIF architecture. This quickly led to the release of a first version of a GBIF Portal toolkit for Nodes (Dec 2002). As there were still no GBIF-mediated data to share at that time, this early portal was mainly a communication tool (featuring a hierarchical directory of links, files and html pages, announcements, news and articles, calendar of events, news channels syndication, etc.…). It also featured a repository for biodiversity data files exported from databases (prefiguring to some degree the approach adopted by the current IPT software in which exported Darwin Core Archives are used to facilitate indexing). Nodes started to deploy the GBIF DiGIR network to publish species occurrence data in the fall of 2004 (BioCASE sites following shortly after). A first prototype GBIF central portal was officially launched in February 2004. In April 2004, Nodes recommended to consider the development of a data portal toolkit for nodes as part of a work program. In October 2004, the recommendation became a ranked priority, second only to hiring a full time Nodes officer. Between May and October 2005, a draft requirements document was developed, a workshop was held in Copenhagen and some resources were allocated to an early prototype presented in April 2006 in South Africa. At that time, the customized portal for nodes was pretty much perceived as a national or thematic subset of the central portal. Subsequently the secretariat focused on the development of a new central portal and the prototype custom portal for nodes was never deployed. In the summer of 2009, an online survey was conducted with preliminary results presented at the Nodes meeting in Copenhagen in October. This led to convening an Advisory Group (AG) in December 2009 in Montreal to work on a scoping document for a Nodes Portal Toolkit (NPT) and a set of recommendations on how to develop, implement and deploy such a toolkit. The AG met again in March 2011 in Madrid and prepared the scoping (S&R) document, under the supervision of the NPT Coordinator. After revision and consultation loops between the NPT AG, the GBIF secretariat and the NPT-Coordinator, the S&R document was publicly released in June 2011. Document conventions The main type of convention used throughout this document helps to represent the level of priority of the different software requirements. These priorities are established in function of many factors, including those identified in the NPT (S&R) document , consultation loops with the NPT stakeholders, and technical constraints which represent the reality at the moment this document is prepared. In the functional requirements section, to keep consistency with the NPT (S&R) document , the same color codes define priorities as defined by the MoSCoW method . Green: NPT V1.0 must have this feature Green: NPT V1.0 must have this feature Yellow: NPT V1.0 should have this feature if at all possible Red: NPT V1.0 could have this feature (if it doesn't affect anything else) Black: NPT V1.0 won't have this feature (maybe in the future) 8 In Use Case surveys , and Use Case sections, priorities and frequency are attributed an increasing index, ranging from 1 (low priority/frequency) to 5 (high priority/frequency). In the nonfunctional requirements section , a series of acronyms are used, as described below: BR = Business Rules CO = Design and Implementation Constraints CR = Capacity Requirements IR = Interoperability Requirements OE = Operating Environment RR = Robustness Requirements ScaR = Scalability Requirements SR = Security Requirements SupR = Supportability Requirements UD = User Documentation UR = Usability Requirements 9 Actor Survey This section lists the different actors NPT instances shall interact with: end users (primary actors) and actors from which the system needs assistance to satisfy a goal (secondary actors).

Operating Environment OE1 The system shall operate with the two latest major releases of the following Web browsers: Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Internet Explorer and Safari. OE2 The system shall operate on a server running Linux, Windows server or Mac OS. Usability Requirements UR1 The interface for end-users should be relatively intuitive and easy to use, without requiring extensive technical assistance, support or off line user guides. UR2 For system managers, guides may be needed to explore advanced functionalities, but those advanced functionalities should be as intuitive as possible. UR3 Maintenance in terms of user interface configuration, user rights management, and data source settings should be done with visual tools. UR4 The system shall allow a visitor to select the language used on the front end. UR5 The system shall display friendly error messages to the users. Supportability Requirements SupR1 A clear and standard practice for the maintenance and documentation of code should be set in place, agreed and communicated as a best practice. Any features developed outside the core of the NPT should follow that practice. User Documentation Requirements UD1 The system shall provide a short tutorial video explaining how to search and export occurrence records. UD2 One offline installation guide with step-by-step instructions shall be provided (with different notes for each OS the system can operate on). 28 UD3 A wiki, organized around the different types of users, on the NPT Google Code site, similar to that developed for the GBIF IPT project will be available. Design and Implementation Constraints CO1 The system shall be implemented using open-source technologies. CO2 The system shall be written in PHP. CO3 The system should be built in a modular way, which ensures that component functionalities can be adjusted, added, improved, removed or exchanged without impacting the application as a whole. Approaching the system using development best practices such as MVC (Model-View-Controller) can allow this sort of modularity. CO4 The NPT development and implementation should follow design principles that will enable future growth, both in terms of the addition of new functionality or through modification of existing functionality. In addition, NPT developers should provide the possibility to consume services and functions that are created elsewhere. Examples include reference taxonomic data sources, mapping functions or web map services (WMS). CO5 Sustainability embedded at each stage of development. The developers of the NPT should be mindful of the strategic implications of development choices to the long term sustainability of the NPT in a number of key areas: underlying hardware and software; development tools and frameworks; level of effort for system administrators and portal managers; level of interest and engagement of users, including researchers, data providers and other interested visitors.

If that does not work, additional instructions are included in the README.txt file included with the build’s .zip folder for running locally. 5.2 Sample Scenarios  The prototype should demonstrate functionality in a variety of scenarios. For simplicity we will explain the scenario in which the driver activates the system, which functions correctly, and then stops paying attention to the road: 37 5 Prototype  A prototype is provided to showcase the conditions in which the HFDS can turn on, how it turns off, and its behavior when it encounters an obstacle. It is a simplistic representation in which most conditions are not as nuanced as the final version will be, and the functionality of the interior cameras, adaptive cruise control and lane detection are more simplistic than the final versions will need to be. The prototype should, however, serve to give an idea of how a more complete system would function. For this prototype we modeled our system on the scenarios requested in the original requirements document provided to us, and functionality is mostly based on that document. The prototype was developed using Unity, and the final prototype was built to WebGL to work in browsers.  In terms of system functionality, the prototype consists of a box (representing a car) with a seat and driver (sphere) on top. The car can be driven when HFDS is not active. When the Hands-Free Driving System is turned on using the button at the top left, the vehicle will drive along a predetermined octagonal path (simulating lane detection). The system will only activate if all sensors are operational, the adaptive cruise control is operational, and a collision is not imminent. If any of those conditions are no longer met while the HFDS is active, it will show several stages of warnings, slowing to a stop in the fourth stage. Obstacles can be placed at the corners of the octagonal path to simulate obstacles on the highway. The system will not always slow to a stop in time to avoid a collision with these obstacles because of their placement at fixed points in the path. The driver will be prompted to retake control faster if a collision is imminent or if a sensor fails than if the system determines that the driver is not paying attention. When a warning stage to retake control is reached, text will appear at the top left explaining steps that will be taken, the vehicle’s color may change, and the seat will vibrate at the third stage. The driver can also supply manual input to the car while HFDS is active, which temporarily pauses HFDS, and if input is continuously supplied, HFDS will disengage completely. 5.1 How to Run Prototype ',\n",

Cheng, Michigan State University 1 Introduction  The Hands-Free Driving System is an embedded software system inside a vehicle that controls the tasks the user would normally handle such as steering the vehicle, accelerating and braking the vehicle. The Hands-Free Driving System (HFDS) description of requirements is split between the following sections, Overall Description, Specific Requirements, Modeling Requirements, and Prototype. The overall description describes information regarding constraints of the user, system, software and hardware as well as how the system will be used in context of Hands-Free Driving. The specific requirements for the HFDS list what is and is not possible for the system to achieve as well as some cybersecurity requirements for the system. The modeling requirements are a low level display of how the system conveys the requirements. The prototype demonstrates the system in action. 1.1 Purpose ',\n",

HFDS will only activate when requested by the user on highways that have been  enabled by the Path Prediction Subsystem Figure 1: Diagram of the high-level goals of the HFDS 2.2 Product Functions  There are many subsystems for the HFDS which need descriptions to understand the system as a whole. One function of the system is called the Driver Assist Subsystem and it grabs data necessary to determine safe conditions. Also it calculates vehicle position, and trajectory ensuring safe following distance. The Driver Attention Subsystem monitors the eye and head movement of the driver to decide whether or not they are paying attention and warns inattentive drivers. The Vehicle Control System uses the driver assist data to decide whether to turn, brake, or accelerate. Human Machine Interface Subsystem is another subsystem that uses data from other systems to display warnings or issues with the system. Path Prediction Subsystem is a system that uses LiDAR, and GPS mapping to create a path for the vehicle to proceed. The last system is the Vehicle Position System which reads information from exterior cameras to give the hands-free driving system the vehicles real world position. 2.3 User Characteristics  There are a few expectations of the user to operate the system. The user is expected to be capable of operating a vehicle and operates the vehicle legally. The user is expected to have knowledge of the Hands-Free Driving and how to use it. 2.4 Constraints 37 5 Prototype  A prototype is provided to showcase the conditions in which the HFDS can turn on, how it turns off, and its behavior when it encounters an obstacle.

IDS is a web-based online drug store that allows for patients to order drugs to fill prescriptions, track the status of placed orders, and offers basic ordering process security. The system also supports internal use by pharmacists who receive customer inquiries over the phone for quotes, orders, and order status information and who maintain the product and customer database. 1.3 Major Constraints IR14 B To track the most popular drugs and make them easier to order on the web site  IR15 A To compare the prices of other competitors and produce a report  IR16 A To produce any advanced report such as a report breaking down the orders by customer region 2.4 User Requirements for Agent ID Category Description ER9 US To produce a patient report listing all the orders/prescriptions they have made over a given timeframe.

The proposed software provides the user with  the ability to browse the news through the e- magazine. There are some features that should be considered in the design of the e-magazine. These One goal of this study is to achieve a user-friendly  interface for IMMITN software and to meet users' needs. The user acceptance of any software lies mainly on how it meets his or her behavioral intention, and this is mostly identified by the degree to which the software meets the wanted needs of the users ( Ayobami and Osman, 2013 ; Davis, 1985 ). Shneiderman et al. (2016) suggested that in a user- centered design technique, user behavior research should be undertaken by studying his or her working environment (i.e., workplace and task list). Authors use the agile usage-centered design method  ( Valacich and George, 2019 ; Patton, 2002 ; 2004 ; Constantine and Lockwood, 2002 ) in order to develop the suggested application. This method is the result of combining both agile and user-centered design techniques. Frequent user involvement in software development is a perfect method to ensure that requirements are captured precisely and directly implemented in software design. However, such continuous interaction works great when the software development team is small, as is the case in the IMMITN application. As well, it is not always possible to continuously reach users throughout the project development period.

In addition, the SRS report consists of a table of contents, indexes such as a list of figures and tables, a glossary that defines the main terms, abbreviations, and This paper proposed an original approach to  develop software requirements document based on the Al-Msie'deen research framework. This research framework was implemented on the IMMITN software system. Results demonstrated that  involving users extensively in the process of defining software requirements and design leads to achieving a dependable and acceptable software system. The study also showed the importance of the method and user-centered design in order to develop the IMMITN application. The reason for choosing the agile approach is that this approach supports changes that can occur at the level of requirements, unlike the waterfall model. On the other hand, the requirements from the beginning cannot be fully defined. As the software  requirements change or as requirements problems are detected, the software design or implementation must be revised, reworked, and tested ( Kotonya and Sommerville, 1998 ). As a software engineer, you should pay attention to the system specifications, as requirements engineering costs about 15% of total system development costs.  Our study is detailed in the rest of this paper as In their research, Ayobami and Osman (2013)  stated that the reason for the software failure to accept is due to the inability of this system to meet the needs and desires of the clients of the software.

More precisely, the goal for the MIP in SGA2 is to capture clinical data from more than 30,000 patients with brain diseases. Most of the data to be incorporated within the MIP will be provided by a few large, existing patient cohorts, via signed partnerships (e.g. CREACTIVE will provide 5,000 patients with TBI, while WP8.10 will provide cohorts of several thousand patients with psychiatric disorders). Other hospitals will contribute smaller cohorts, of around 1,000 patients.  The SP8 SGA2 Medical Informatics Platform contributes to SGA2 Key Results KR8.1, KR8.2, KR8.3, and KR8.4, as described in the SGA2 Grant Agreement (GA). 2. Glossary The MIP will evolve in SGA2 and will be enhanced with new federated analytics capabilities, such as new algorithms (FR2), enhanced visualisations and workflow management. New types of data will also be supported (The Virtual Brain, EEG). Additionally, in SGA2, the MIP will strengthen privacy guarantees (FR1, FR2) regarding MIP-federated analyses. By combining the new features described in this document with the goal of installing the MIP in over 30 hospitals by the end of SGA2, we strongly believe that, by then, the MIP will reach the goal of being an essential open- access component of clinical neuroscience research in Europe. 21 https://github.com/BlueBrain/nexus 22 https://github.com D8.5.1 (D52.1 D4) SGA2 M3 SUBMITTED 181217.docx PU = Public 17-Dec-2018 Page 16 / 21 13.

Introduction  The MIP aims to enable breakthrough medical progress in the field of brain diseases through federated analysis of data residing in a wide network of hospitals.  More precisely, the goal for the MIP in SGA2 is to capture clinical data from more than 30,000 patients with brain diseases. Most of the data to be incorporated within the MIP will be provided by a few large, existing patient cohorts, via signed partnerships (e.g. CREACTIVE will provide 5,000 patients with TBI, while WP8.10 will provide cohorts of several thousand patients with psychiatric disorders). Other hospitals will contribute smaller cohorts, of around 1,000 patients. ',\n",

The scientific workflow engine is responsible for the orchestration and execution of the scientific workflows. These workflows will be designed using the Galaxy editor, and their metadata and definition will be stored in the Workflow Library. An overview of the workflow architecture is depicted in Figure 4.

Figure 4: Workflow architecture overview D8.5.1 (D52.1 D4) SGA2 M3 SUBMITTED 181217.docx PU = Public 17-Dec-2018 Page 18 / 21  The modus operandi of workflow execution within this architecture is the following: The MIP users will use the portal to search for existing datasets, upload their own data, design workflows and submit them for execution to the workflow engine. Authentication actions rely on the Authentication and Authorisation Infrastructure supporting the platform. Figure 2: MIP condensed logical architecture  The above schema illustrates the logical architecture of MIP in SGA2. The grey coloured MIP Local Components represent the anonymised federated store / database that is described in FR1.  An expanded logical architecture will follow in future Deliverables; this figure is not intended to guide development, but rather to communicate MIP’s key characteristics and operation, in combination with MIP processing flows in Figure 3. Figure 4: Workflow architecture overview D8.5.1 (D52.1 D4) SGA2 M3 SUBMITTED 181217.docx PU = Public 17-Dec-2018 Page 18 / 21  The modus operandi of workflow execution within this architecture is the following: The MIP users will use the portal to search for existing datasets, upload their own data, design workflows and submit them for execution to the workflow engine. Authentication actions rely on the Authentication and Authorisation Infrastructure supporting the platform.  In the MIP, processing components or whole consolidated applications are wrapped as Docker images and are registered on the platform’s specific Docker Registry; the respective metadata for them are stored in the workflow library. Figure 3 shows the analysis processing flows in the MIP. Flow (1a) represents the flow for an experiment that runs in one hospital, while flow (1b) represents the flow of an experiment that runs in multiple hospitals and addresses additional privacy concerns. In flow (1), we show that there is a single point of entry to the platform. The invocation of the appropriate processing flow (local, federated) is data-driven; when a user selects remote data, the evaluation moves to federated mode.  To support the above architecture (see Figure 2), the implementation/enhancement of the following related software components are required, namely: 1) Workflow engine, 2) Federated engine and 3) Anonymisation.  The scientific workflow engine is responsible for the orchestration and execution of the scientific workflows.

OVERALL DESCRIPTION 2.1 Product Perspective  Simulacrum: Simulated Virtual Reality for Emergency Medical Intervention in Battle  Field Conditions is a virtual reality simulation project that has the purpose of training first aid and medical intervention techniques in battlefield conditions. The project divided into two parts: training mode and battlefield conditions mode. For developing the project, we have planned to use Scrum which is an agile software  development methodology. Scrum is incremental and iterative. In scrum, main work is divided into sprints which should be completed within a certain period of time which could be 30 days on average. Iteration length of every sprint must be equal, because scrum is an agile development methodology. Every Sprint includes tasks which has own story points and risk points. Development team should have a daily meeting every morning which should be maximum 15 minutes. Scrum has three main roles which are product owner, scrum master and development team. Product owner is the person who delivers the requirements, scrum master is the person who manages the development team. Development team is the group of developers who work on the project according to schedule. There are some advantages of Scrum. First advantage is that it is easier to cope with changes because of short sprints and constant feedback. Another advantage is problems can be handled swiftly due to morning meetings. Also, it makes it possible to create quality products in scheduled time [1]. Figure 1 represents four sprints of the project on the lab board. Sprint is one of the most important feature for Scrum methodology. At the end of each sprint, a part of project has been completed and it has been presented to customer for validation. By taking into consideration of these facts, Scrum is the most suitable methodology for the project. 6  Figure 1 All Sprints of the Project on the Board Simulacrum: Simulated Virtual Reality for Emergency Medical Intervention in Battle  Field Conditions is a virtual reality simulation project that has the purpose of training first aid and medical intervention techniques in battlefield conditions.

Attributes  Operations Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Project CACC++ 2 Authors: Erich Hairston, Dean Dawson, Gabrie Italia, Evan Shoup, Kaela Burger Customer: Mr. Bill Milam Instructor: Dr. Betty Cheng 1 Introduction Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control++ (CACC++) is a system which expands the current capabilities of Adaptive Cruise Control to make the system safer and easier to use. CACC++ enables a vehicle to follow a platoon with the use of sensors to detect nearby vehicles and follow safety procedures, while maintaining a constant speed and distance set by the driver. To achieve an advanced system, key points such as functionality, requirements, constraints, and dependencies highlight the importance of the necessary details in the CACC++ system. Models are included to provide more detailed interpretations, as well as a prototype that demonstrates several scenarios in which the system behaves. The CACC++ system contains subsystems that include sensors, communication, and control of the vehicle to function without the dependency of an operator. 1.1 Purpose A functional CACC++ relies on its underlying subsystems and allows the interaction between infrastructure and the vehicle with the appropriate actions to such scenarios. The purpose of the software requirements specification is to help the customer understand the team’s interpretation of the product and their approach on how to achieve a system that follows the requirements. Several diagrams are provided that describe the CACC++ system in detail and how it is used daily to provide a better understanding for the reader. A domain model is included, which maps out the main components of the system. A use case diagram is also added, which models common high level behaviors of the system. Sequence diagrams, which describe the interactions between the classes in the domain model in different scenarios are also included. And lastly, state diagrams are included which describe how components of our system move through different states and respond to outside messages. 1.2 Scope CACC++ is a system available in a vehicle that allows the driver to let the vehicle operate independently and follow traffic regulations. To achieve this goal, the CACC++ communicates with nearby vehicles, using sensor detection, and control of the actuators in the vehicle. This expands on the current capabilities of Adaptive Cruise Control with the intent to make it safer. CACC++ is an embedded system for automotive systems that provides convenience to the operator and provides opportunities for optimization as vehicles send each other signals to communicate. When CACC++ is active, the vehicle will be a part of a platoon, follow the lead vehicle and act appropriately by altering the vehicle\\'s distance and speed based on the communication with the lead vehicle. Another case is that under CACC++ the vehicle is the lead vehicle, in which case it will lead the platoon and communicate with the vehicles behind it. A vehicle will be able to join the platoon through input within the cars user interface, and sometimes the user will be prompted on possible opportunities to join a platoon. The system is intended to support acceleration/deceleration, lateral direction, security precautions, and communication within a platoon. 1.3 Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations ● VC \\u200b : Vehicle Controller, a system within the vehicle that communicates to subsystems and sends information that updates ● CACC++ \\u200b : Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control ● OEM \\u200b : Original Equipment Manufacturer ● \\u200b ITS \\u200b : Intelligent Transport Systems, an application that aims to optimize traffic efficiency and provide safer traffic management ● Target \\u200b : a vehicle or object in front of the vehicle that is being tracked ● GUI \\u200b : Graphical user interface, the screen and buttons with which the user can interact with 1.4 Organization The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

And lastly, in Section 2.6 approportioned requirements will be described. 2.1 Product Perspective The CACC++ system is a product to be used in vehicles to expand the current capabilities of Adaptive Cruise Control, with the goal to increase safety. The CACC++ system is made of many smaller subsystems which it coordinates and controls. So, while the CACC++ is an independent system within the vehicle, it still must coordinate with all other major systems within the vehicle. There are many ways in which a user will interact with the system. A user will be able to use buttons on the steering wheel or utilize a center console screen to turn the system on and off. Furthermore, they can make necessary adjustments to the preferred following speed and distance. In addition, the user will be able to use the brakes to disengage the system. Lastly, through the GUI, the user is able to receive feedback from the system. As for hardware constraints, the vehicle must have actuators installed on the throttle and the brakes for the purpose of monitoring and controlling the acceleration of the vehicle. In addition, a radar and camera must be installed at the front of the vehicle to receive information about targets. Other hardware constraints include a GPS system and a radio to communicate with other vehicles. Lastly, a vehicle controller and independent monitoring system must be present in the vehicle for the system to work. Every subsystem must have software to allow for operation and communication within the system. The vehicle controller must also have software to manage all of the subsystems, in addition to software for an independent monitoring system. There must also be software to handle communications from external sources within the radio. The last major constraint of the system is memory. As the system will be embedded on a vehicle, the size of the vehicle\\'s memory limits the system size and the amount of space available for data. This constraint in memory will subsequently affect the software constraints as well. Lastly, certain safety critical systems require a backup memory to allow for system updates to be more easily carried out during operation. 2.2 Product Functions The CACC++ system consists of many different subsystems that are utilized at different times depending on what the vehicle needs to do. These include acceleration, braking, and communication with other vehicles. The CACC++ system handles these 3  Template based on IEEE Std 830-1998 for SRS. Modifications (content and ordering of information) have been made by Betty H.C. Cheng, Michigan State University (chengb at msu.edu) subsystems using sensors, radars, and other data to control the vehicle for the user on the roadway. The product also allows the user to set a safe following distance between themselves and other vehicles. The subsystems help the CACC++ by detecting and communicating with the system so that it will take appropriate action to traffic. The driver can enable the CACC++ system to join or leave a platoon. When the vehicle is part of a platoon, it communicates with other vehicles and uses the information to update the speed and distance to be in uniform with the platoon. The driver can leave the platoon by turning off the system or exiting the lane. During typical use, the system utilizes the GPS and the radio to send GPS packets to platoon vehicles behind the vehicle. The radio is also used to receive GPS packets from platoon vehicles ahead of it. The information from the GPS is combined with data from the radar and camera to track targets, and determine if they are moving or stationary. The information on the target is then used to determine if the system must accelerate, decelerate, brake, or notify the user of any actions they must take. Other functions of the system include communication with ITS and the OEM cloud, and handling system updates. 2.3 User Characteristics The user of the system should be a licensed driver that follows all traffic laws. The user must also be able to read and interact with notifications, alerts, and different types of controls on a screen inside the vehicle. The user is also expected to choose and maintain both the safe following distance and traveling speed when using the system. Lastly, the user must be alert and ready to take control of the vehicle in case of an emergency or system malfunction. 2.4 Constraints As the system controls the acceleration of the vehicle, there are quite a few safety critical properties. Firstly, the system must be independently monitored to ensure that the commands being issued to the different parts of the system are correct. The electronic throttle control and brake by wire must also be fully functional for the system to operate, and if either are determined to be functioning incorrectly, control of the vehicle should be deferred back to the user. If the throttle control and brakes were not operating correctly, unintended acceleration or braking can occur which would put the user at risk. Another safety critical property is a working radar and camera. In certain situations the camera can be used when the radar fails, but if both the radar and camera are not working properly, then control must be deferred once again to the user. The camera and radar are responsible for determining the speed of the vehicle and classifying the target\\'s speed, location, and whether collision will occur. Any error in any of those responsibilities can put the user in danger and compromises safety. In addition, if any of the main system components such as the radar, camera, and actuators are determined to be not functioning properly, then the system should not be 4 Template based on IEEE Std 830-1998 for SRS.

Modifications (content and ordering of information) have been made by Betty H.C. Cheng, Michigan State University (chengb at msu.edu) allowed to start and take control of the vehicle, as if it does take control, safety will be compromised. Other constraints include signal timing. Messages from the vehicle controller to the actuators and the UI must be nearly instantaneous. If the vehicle controller must issue emergency braking commands to the brakes and the UI, a significant delay in the receipt of that message can cause a collision. For this reason, the timing of these messages must be nearly instantaneous to ensure safety. Lastly, parallel operation of the CACC++ with other systems within the vehicle is another constraint of the system. The CACC++ must not interfere with the operation of other systems in the vehicle. In addition, the vehicle controller and independent monitoring system must be able to handle contradicting messages from different systems within the vehicle and determine the correct action to take. 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies For the development of the CACC++, the vehicle is assumed to have both acceleration and braking potential, and is assumed to be functional. Additionally, it can be assumed that the previous software for cruise control works and the cooperative portion of the software is installed properly. It is assumed that the system will not operate when the vehicle is on unmarked roads. The user operates the vehicle properly and knows when the system should be in use. In addition, it is assumed that the system only operates when all the subsystems are fully functional, and that any loss in functionality is detected through independent monitoring of our system which will then notify the user and defer control back to them. 2.6 Approportioning of Requirements In the future, the CACC++ may evolve to include more security measures to keep user and vehicle data safe and allow for more over-the-air updates. 3 Specific Requirements This section contains a hierarchical list of requirements for the CACC++ system. The requirements are listed in order of importance, and are separated into global invariant, primary, and secondary requirements. The primary requirements are also separated into hardware requirements, software requirements, and security requirements. 1. Global Invariant Requirements 1.1. Prevent Injury to passengers, and ensure the system is not at fault for a collision. 1.2. Always attempt to avoid an imminent collision with a target through applying brakes, notifying the user, and ceasing acceleration. 1.3. Allow the user to regain control of the system when needed. The user should never be \"locked out\" of the system. 5 Template based on IEEE Std 830-1998 for SRS. Modifications (content and ordering of information) have been made by Betty H.C.

Independent monitoring of the VC commands should always occur to ensure reliability and integrity. 1.7. Diagnose and correct system issues when they occur, to recover to an operational state, which includes returning control to the user. 1.8. The CACC++ must never operate concurrently with the manual operation by the user and must not interfere with the operation of other systems within the vehicle. 1.9. The CACC++ must be able to operate with a platoon, and if the platoon is not present then the system must operate as Adaptive Cruise Control. 2. Primary Requirements 2.1. Hardware 2.1.1. Long Range Radars - To implement adaptive cruise control and monitor possible obstacles in the way of the driver there needs to be a way to “see\" a great distance in front of the vehicle. 2.1.2. Short Range Radars - Necessary to detect other vehicles or obstacles in closer proximity to the vehicle. Necessary to have them on the sides and rear of the vehicle to implement lane assist, detect vehicles to the right, left or rear of the vehicle, to detect obstacles such as vehicles, pedestrians or objects when driving in reverse, and to detect when a vehicle is approaching too close to the rear of the vehicle. 2.1.3. Cameras - Needed for rear view assistance when driving in reverse, driver monitoring to ensure a driver is available and ready to take over the vehicle when transitioning between CACC++ and manual control, and even for blind spot visibility. Satellite cameras can also be used to give an aerial overview of the vehicle\\'s position on the road. 2.1.4. Actuator Controls - Used to handle the actual functionality of CACC++ from an operating standpoint. Actuators would be responsible for breaking when approaching a vehicle or obstacle in front of or behind the vehicle, changing the trajectory of the vehicle on curves or to implement lane assist, and to accelerate the vehicle to keep the appropriate speed when on slopes or when needed. 2.1.5. Internal Sensors - Allow the system to know specific statuses of internal parts of the vehicle. There are many sensors already present in cars, but the sensors that are pertinent to CACC++ would be sensors that monitor things such as wheel speed, deceleration, assisted braking, acceleration, and other internal functions. 6 ',\n",

CACC++ enables a vehicle to follow a platoon with the use of sensors to detect nearby vehicles and follow safety procedures, while maintaining a constant speed and distance set by the driver. To achieve an advanced system, key points such as functionality, requirements, constraints, and dependencies highlight the importance of the necessary details in the CACC++ system. Models are included to provide more detailed interpretations, as well as a prototype that demonstrates several scenarios in which the system behaves. The CACC++ system contains subsystems that include sensors, communication, and control of the vehicle to function without the dependency of an operator. 1.1 Purpose A functional CACC++ relies on its underlying subsystems and allows the interaction between infrastructure and the vehicle with the appropriate actions to such scenarios. The purpose of the software requirements specification is to help the customer understand the team’s interpretation of the product and their approach on how to achieve a system that follows the requirements. Several diagrams are provided that describe the CACC++ system in detail and how it is used daily to provide a better understanding for the reader. A domain model is included, which maps out the main components of the system. A use case diagram is also added, which models common high level behaviors of the system. Sequence diagrams, which describe the interactions between the classes in the domain model in different scenarios are also included. And lastly, state diagrams are included which describe how components of our system move through different states and respond to outside messages. 1.2 Scope CACC++ is a system available in a vehicle that allows the driver to let the vehicle operate independently and follow traffic regulations. To achieve this goal, the CACC++ communicates with nearby vehicles, using sensor detection, and control of the actuators in the vehicle. This expands on the current capabilities of Adaptive Cruise Control with the intent to make it safer. CACC++ is an embedded system for automotive systems that provides convenience to the operator and provides opportunities for optimization as vehicles send each other signals to communicate. When CACC++ is active, the vehicle will be a part of a platoon, follow the lead vehicle and act appropriately by altering the vehicle\\'s distance and speed based on the communication with the lead vehicle. Another case is that under CACC++ the vehicle is the lead vehicle, in which case it will lead the platoon and communicate with the vehicles behind it. A vehicle will be able to join the platoon through input within the cars user interface, and sometimes the user will be prompted on possible opportunities to join a platoon. The system is intended to support acceleration/deceleration, lateral direction, security precautions, and communication within a platoon. 1.3 Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations ● VC \\u200b : Vehicle Controller, a system within the vehicle that communicates to subsystems and sends information that updates ● CACC++ \\u200b : Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control ● OEM \\u200b : Original Equipment Manufacturer ● \\u200b ITS \\u200b : Intelligent Transport Systems, an application that aims to optimize traffic efficiency and provide safer traffic management ● Target \\u200b : a vehicle or object in front of the vehicle that is being tracked ● GUI \\u200b : Graphical user interface, the screen and buttons with which the user can interact with 1.4 Organization The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

Section 2.1 contains the context of the system, as well as the constraints on our system. Section 2.2 outlines the main functionality of the system. Section 2.3 describes the average user of our system as well as their expected experience level. Section 2.4 further discusses constraints on the system.

And lastly, in Section 2.6 approportioned requirements will be described. 2.1 Product Perspective The CACC++ system is a product to be used in vehicles to expand the current capabilities of Adaptive Cruise Control, with the goal to increase safety. The CACC++ system is made of many smaller subsystems which it coordinates and controls. So, while the CACC++ is an independent system within the vehicle, it still must coordinate with all other major systems within the vehicle. There are many ways in which a user will interact with the system. A user will be able to use buttons on the steering wheel or utilize a center console screen to turn the system on and off. Furthermore, they can make necessary adjustments to the preferred following speed and distance. In addition, the user will be able to use the brakes to disengage the system. Lastly, through the GUI, the user is able to receive feedback from the system. As for hardware constraints, the vehicle must have actuators installed on the throttle and the brakes for the purpose of monitoring and controlling the acceleration of the vehicle. In addition, a radar and camera must be installed at the front of the vehicle to receive information about targets. Other hardware constraints include a GPS system and a radio to communicate with other vehicles. Lastly, a vehicle controller and independent monitoring system must be present in the vehicle for the system to work. Every subsystem must have software to allow for operation and communication within the system. The vehicle controller must also have software to manage all of the subsystems, in addition to software for an independent monitoring system. There must also be software to handle communications from external sources within the radio. The last major constraint of the system is memory. As the system will be embedded on a vehicle, the size of the vehicle\\'s memory limits the system size and the amount of space available for data. This constraint in memory will subsequently affect the software constraints as well. Lastly, certain safety critical systems require a backup memory to allow for system updates to be more easily carried out during operation. 2.2 Product Functions The CACC++ system consists of many different subsystems that are utilized at different times depending on what the vehicle needs to do. These include acceleration, braking, and communication with other vehicles. The CACC++ system handles these 3  Template based on IEEE Std 830-1998 for SRS. Modifications (content and ordering of information) have been made by Betty H.C. Cheng, Michigan State University (chengb at msu.edu) subsystems using sensors, radars, and other data to control the vehicle for the user on the roadway. The product also allows the user to set a safe following distance between themselves and other vehicles. The subsystems help the CACC++ by detecting and communicating with the system so that it will take appropriate action to traffic. The driver can enable the CACC++ system to join or leave a platoon. When the vehicle is part of a platoon, it communicates with other vehicles and uses the information to update the speed and distance to be in uniform with the platoon. The driver can leave the platoon by turning off the system or exiting the lane. During typical use, the system utilizes the GPS and the radio to send GPS packets to platoon vehicles behind the vehicle. The radio is also used to receive GPS packets from platoon vehicles ahead of it. The information from the GPS is combined with data from the radar and camera to track targets, and determine if they are moving or stationary. The information on the target is then used to determine if the system must accelerate, decelerate, brake, or notify the user of any actions they must take. Other functions of the system include communication with ITS and the OEM cloud, and handling system updates. 2.3 User Characteristics The user of the system should be a licensed driver that follows all traffic laws. The user must also be able to read and interact with notifications, alerts, and different types of controls on a screen inside the vehicle. The user is also expected to choose and maintain both the safe following distance and traveling speed when using the system. Lastly, the user must be alert and ready to take control of the vehicle in case of an emergency or system malfunction. 2.4 Constraints As the system controls the acceleration of the vehicle, there are quite a few safety critical properties. Firstly, the system must be independently monitored to ensure that the commands being issued to the different parts of the system are correct. The electronic throttle control and brake by wire must also be fully functional for the system to operate, and if either are determined to be functioning incorrectly, control of the vehicle should be deferred back to the user. If the throttle control and brakes were not operating correctly, unintended acceleration or braking can occur which would put the user at risk. Another safety critical property is a working radar and camera. In certain situations the camera can be used when the radar fails, but if both the radar and camera are not working properly, then control must be deferred once again to the user. The camera and radar are responsible for determining the speed of the vehicle and classifying the target\\'s speed, location, and whether collision will occur. Any error in any of those responsibilities can put the user in danger and compromises safety. In addition, if any of the main system components such as the radar, camera, and actuators are determined to be not functioning properly, then the system should not be 4 Template based on IEEE Std 830-1998 for SRS.

Modifications (content and ordering of information) have been made by Betty H.C. Cheng, Michigan State University (chengb at msu.edu) allowed to start and take control of the vehicle, as if it does take control, safety will be compromised. Other constraints include signal timing. Messages from the vehicle controller to the actuators and the UI must be nearly instantaneous. If the vehicle controller must issue emergency braking commands to the brakes and the UI, a significant delay in the receipt of that message can cause a collision. For this reason, the timing of these messages must be nearly instantaneous to ensure safety. Lastly, parallel operation of the CACC++ with other systems within the vehicle is another constraint of the system. The CACC++ must not interfere with the operation of other systems in the vehicle. In addition, the vehicle controller and independent monitoring system must be able to handle contradicting messages from different systems within the vehicle and determine the correct action to take. 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies For the development of the CACC++, the vehicle is assumed to have both acceleration and braking potential, and is assumed to be functional. Additionally, it can be assumed that the previous software for cruise control works and the cooperative portion of the software is installed properly. It is assumed that the system will not operate when the vehicle is on unmarked roads. The user operates the vehicle properly and knows when the system should be in use. In addition, it is assumed that the system only operates when all the subsystems are fully functional, and that any loss in functionality is detected through independent monitoring of our system which will then notify the user and defer control back to them. 2.6 Approportioning of Requirements In the future, the CACC++ may evolve to include more security measures to keep user and vehicle data safe and allow for more over-the-air updates. 3 Specific Requirements This section contains a hierarchical list of requirements for the CACC++ system. The requirements are listed in order of importance, and are separated into global invariant, primary, and secondary requirements. The primary requirements are also separated into hardware requirements, software requirements, and security requirements. 1. Global Invariant Requirements 1.1. Prevent Injury to passengers, and ensure the system is not at fault for a collision. 1.2. Always attempt to avoid an imminent collision with a target through applying brakes, notifying the user, and ceasing acceleration. 1.3. Allow the user to regain control of the system when needed. The user should never be \"locked out\" of the system. 5  Template based on IEEE Std 830-1998 for SRS. Modifications (content and ordering of information) have been made by Betty H.C. Cheng, Michigan State University (chengb at msu.edu) 1.4. Acceleration should not be applied when the distance to the target is below a safe distance. 1.5. Ensure Safe Operation of the vehicle when the system is active by following speed limits and traffic laws. 1.6. Independent monitoring of the VC commands should always occur to ensure reliability and integrity. 1.7. Diagnose and correct system issues when they occur, to recover to an operational state, which includes returning control to the user. 1.8. The CACC++ must never operate concurrently with the manual operation by the user and must not interfere with the operation of other systems within the vehicle. 1.9. The CACC++ must be able to operate with a platoon, and if the platoon is not present then the system must operate as Adaptive Cruise Control. 2. Primary Requirements 2.1. Hardware 2.1.1. Long Range Radars - To implement adaptive cruise control and monitor possible obstacles in the way of the driver there needs to be a way to “see\" a great distance in front of the vehicle. 2.1.2. Short Range Radars - Necessary to detect other vehicles or obstacles in closer proximity to the vehicle. Necessary to have them on the sides and rear of the vehicle to implement lane assist, detect vehicles to the right, left or rear of the vehicle, to detect obstacles such as vehicles, pedestrians or objects when driving in reverse, and to detect when a vehicle is approaching too close to the rear of the vehicle. 2.1.3. Cameras - Needed for rear view assistance when driving in reverse, driver monitoring to ensure a driver is available and ready to take over the vehicle when transitioning between CACC++ and manual control, and even for blind spot visibility. Satellite cameras can also be used to give an aerial overview of the vehicle\\'s position on the road. 2.1.4. Actuator Controls - Used to handle the actual functionality of CACC++ from an operating standpoint. Actuators would be responsible for breaking when approaching a vehicle or obstacle in front of or behind the vehicle, changing the trajectory of the vehicle on curves or to implement lane assist, and to accelerate the vehicle to keep the appropriate speed when on slopes or when needed. 2.1.5. Internal Sensors - Allow the system to know specific statuses of internal parts of the vehicle. There are many sensors already present in cars, but the sensors that are pertinent to CACC++ would be sensors that monitor things such as wheel speed, deceleration, assisted braking, acceleration, and other internal functions. 6 Template based on IEEE Std 830-1998 for SRS.

This information will be used in conjunction with other location information to help determine targets and proper speed to maintain on a given road. 2.2. Software 2.2.1. Detect and track targets in front using radar, cameras, and GPS, and determine if they are moving or fixed. 2.2.2. Communicate GPS and packet information from the vehicles in front of you to vehicles behind you using radio. 2.2.3. When following a target vehicle, always attempt to match their speed and maintain a safe following distance. 2.2.4. Ensure that the platoon travels in a coordinated and safe manner, by not travelling at unsafe speeds for the given roads, with safe spacing, and with fully functioning subsystems. 2.2.5. When an inappropriate command is given in the system, flag the issue and send it to the OEM cloud. 2.2.6. When the platoon is decelerating or stopping, allow vehicles with less braking power to begin decelerating first. 2.2.7.

The VC must be able to receive software updates while still functioning.

       "  'What are the requirements functional non functional': 'Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Project CACC++ 2 Authors: Erich Hairston, Dean Dawson, Gabrie Italia, Evan Shoup, Kaela Burger Customer: Mr. Bill Milam Instructor: Dr. Betty Cheng 1 Introduction Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control++ (CACC++) is a system which expands the current capabilities of Adaptive Cruise Control to make the system safer and easier to use. CACC++ enables a vehicle to follow a platoon with the use of sensors to detect nearby vehicles and follow safety procedures, while maintaining a constant speed and distance set by the driver. To achieve an advanced system, key points such as functionality, requirements, constraints, and dependencies highlight the importance of the necessary details in the CACC++ system. Models are included to provide more detailed interpretations, as well as a prototype that demonstrates several scenarios in which the system behaves. The CACC++ system contains subsystems that include sensors, communication, and control of the vehicle to function without the dependency of an operator. 1.1 Purpose A functional CACC++ relies on its underlying subsystems and allows the interaction between infrastructure and the vehicle with the appropriate actions to such scenarios. The purpose of the software requirements specification is to help the customer understand the team’s interpretation of the product and their approach on how to achieve a system that follows the requirements. Several diagrams are provided that describe the CACC++ system in detail and how it is used daily to provide a better understanding for the reader. A domain model is included, which maps out the main components of the system. A use case diagram is also added, which models common high level behaviors of the system. Sequence diagrams, which describe the interactions between the classes in the domain model in different scenarios are also included. And lastly, state diagrams are included which describe how components of our system move through different states and respond to outside messages. 1.2 Scope CACC++ is a system available in a vehicle that allows the driver to let the vehicle operate independently and follow traffic regulations. To achieve this goal, the CACC++ communicates with nearby vehicles, using sensor detection, and control of the actuators in the vehicle. This expands on the current capabilities of Adaptive Cruise Control with the intent to make it safer. CACC++ is an embedded system for automotive systems that provides convenience to the operator and provides opportunities for optimization as vehicles send each other signals to communicate. When CACC++ is active, the vehicle will be a part of a platoon, follow the lead vehicle and act appropriately by altering the vehicle\\'s distance and speed based on the communication with the lead vehicle. Another case is that under CACC++ the vehicle is the lead vehicle, in which case it will lead the platoon and communicate with the vehicles behind it. A vehicle will be able to join the platoon through input within the cars user interface, and sometimes the user will be prompted on possible opportunities to join a platoon. The system is intended to support acceleration/deceleration, lateral direction, security precautions, and communication within a platoon. 1.3 Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations ● VC \\u200b : Vehicle Controller, a system within the vehicle that communicates to subsystems and sends information that updates ● CACC++ \\u200b : Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control ● OEM \\u200b : Original Equipment Manufacturer ● \\u200b ITS \\u200b : Intelligent Transport Systems, an application that aims to optimize traffic efficiency and provide safer traffic management ● Target \\u200b : a vehicle or object in front of the vehicle that is being tracked ● GUI \\u200b : Graphical user interface, the screen and buttons with which the user can interact with 1.4 Organization The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

Section 2.1 contains the context of the system, as well as the constraints on our system. Section 2.2 outlines the main functionality of the system. Section 2.3 describes the average user of our system as well as their expected experience level. Section 2.4 further discusses constraints on the system. In Section 2.5, key assumptions about our system environment will be discussed. And lastly, in Section 2.6 approportioned requirements will be described. 2.1 Product Perspective The CACC++ system is a product to be used in vehicles to expand the current capabilities of Adaptive Cruise Control, with the goal to increase safety. The CACC++ system is made of many smaller subsystems which it coordinates and controls. So, while the CACC++ is an independent system within the vehicle, it still must coordinate with all other major systems within the vehicle. There are many ways in which a user will interact with the system. A user will be able to use buttons on the steering wheel or utilize a center console screen to turn the system on and off. Furthermore, they can make necessary adjustments to the preferred following speed and distance. In addition, the user will be able to use the brakes to disengage the system. Lastly, through the GUI, the user is able to receive feedback from the system. As for hardware constraints, the vehicle must have actuators installed on the throttle and the brakes for the purpose of monitoring and controlling the acceleration of the vehicle. In addition, a radar and camera must be installed at the front of the vehicle to receive information about targets. Other hardware constraints include a GPS system and a radio to communicate with other vehicles. Lastly, a vehicle controller and independent monitoring system must be present in the vehicle for the system to work. Every subsystem must have software to allow for operation and communication within the system. The vehicle controller must also have software to manage all of the subsystems, in addition to software for an independent monitoring system. There must also be software to handle communications from external sources within the radio. The last major constraint of the system is memory. As the system will be embedded on a vehicle, the size of the vehicle\\'s memory limits the system size and the amount of space available for data. This constraint in memory will subsequently affect the software constraints as well. Lastly, certain safety critical systems require a backup memory to allow for system updates to be more easily carried out during operation. 2.2 Product Functions The CACC++ system consists of many different subsystems that are utilized at different times depending on what the vehicle needs to do. These include acceleration, braking, and communication with other vehicles. The CACC++ system handles these 3  Template based on IEEE Std 830-1998 for SRS. Modifications (content and ordering of information) have been made by Betty H.C. Cheng, Michigan State University (chengb at msu.edu) subsystems using sensors, radars, and other data to control the vehicle for the user on the roadway. The product also allows the user to set a safe following distance between themselves and other vehicles. The subsystems help the CACC++ by detecting and communicating with the system so that it will take appropriate action to traffic. The driver can enable the CACC++ system to join or leave a platoon. When the vehicle is part of a platoon, it communicates with other vehicles and uses the information to update the speed and distance to be in uniform with the platoon. The driver can leave the platoon by turning off the system or exiting the lane. During typical use, the system utilizes the GPS and the radio to send GPS packets to platoon vehicles behind the vehicle. The radio is also used to receive GPS packets from platoon vehicles ahead of it. The information from the GPS is combined with data from the radar and camera to track targets, and determine if they are moving or stationary. The information on the target is then used to determine if the system must accelerate, decelerate, brake, or notify the user of any actions they must take. Other functions of the system include communication with ITS and the OEM cloud, and handling system updates. 2.3 User Characteristics The user of the system should be a licensed driver that follows all traffic laws. The user must also be able to read and interact with notifications, alerts, and different types of controls on a screen inside the vehicle. The user is also expected to choose and maintain both the safe following distance and traveling speed when using the system. Lastly, the user must be alert and ready to take control of the vehicle in case of an emergency or system malfunction. 2.4 Constraints As the system controls the acceleration of the vehicle, there are quite a few safety critical properties. Firstly, the system must be independently monitored to ensure that the commands being issued to the different parts of the system are correct. The electronic throttle control and brake by wire must also be fully functional for the system to operate, and if either are determined to be functioning incorrectly, control of the vehicle should be deferred back to the user. If the throttle control and brakes were not operating correctly, unintended acceleration or braking can occur which would put the user at risk. Another safety critical property is a working radar and camera. In certain situations the camera can be used when the radar fails, but if both the radar and camera are not working properly, then control must be deferred once again to the user. The camera and radar are responsible for determining the speed of the vehicle and classifying the target\\'s speed, location, and whether collision will occur. Any error in any of those responsibilities can put the user in danger and compromises safety. In addition, if any of the main system components such as the radar, camera, and actuators are determined to be not functioning properly, then the system should not be 4 Template based on IEEE Std 830-1998 for SRS.

Modifications (content and ordering of information) have been made by Betty H.C. Cheng, Michigan State University (chengb at msu.edu) allowed to start and take control of the vehicle, as if it does take control, safety will be compromised. Other constraints include signal timing. Messages from the vehicle controller to the actuators and the UI must be nearly instantaneous. If the vehicle controller must issue emergency braking commands to the brakes and the UI, a significant delay in the receipt of that message can cause a collision. For this reason, the timing of these messages must be nearly instantaneous to ensure safety. Lastly, parallel operation of the CACC++ with other systems within the vehicle is another constraint of the system. The CACC++ must not interfere with the operation of other systems in the vehicle. In addition, the vehicle controller and independent monitoring system must be able to handle contradicting messages from different systems within the vehicle and determine the correct action to take. 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies For the development of the CACC++, the vehicle is assumed to have both acceleration and braking potential, and is assumed to be functional. Additionally, it can be assumed that the previous software for cruise control works and the cooperative portion of the software is installed properly. It is assumed that the system will not operate when the vehicle is on unmarked roads. The user operates the vehicle properly and knows when the system should be in use. In addition, it is assumed that the system only operates when all the subsystems are fully functional, and that any loss in functionality is detected through independent monitoring of our system which will then notify the user and defer control back to them. 2.6 Approportioning of Requirements In the future, the CACC++ may evolve to include more security measures to keep user and vehicle data safe and allow for more over-the-air updates. 3 Specific Requirements This section contains a hierarchical list of requirements for the CACC++ system. The requirements are listed in order of importance, and are separated into global invariant, primary, and secondary requirements. The primary requirements are also separated into hardware requirements, software requirements, and security requirements. 1. Global Invariant Requirements 1.1. Prevent Injury to passengers, and ensure the system is not at fault for a collision. 1.2. Always attempt to avoid an imminent collision with a target through applying brakes, notifying the user, and ceasing acceleration. 1.3. Allow the user to regain control of the system when needed. The user should never be \"locked out\" of the system. 5 Template based on IEEE Std 830-1998 for SRS. Modifications (content and ordering of information) have been made by Betty H.C.

The CACC++ must be able to operate with a platoon, and if the platoon is not present then the system must operate as Adaptive Cruise Control. 2. Primary Requirements 2.1. Hardware 2.1.1. Long Range Radars - To implement adaptive cruise control and monitor possible obstacles in the way of the driver there needs to be a way to “see\" a great distance in front of the vehicle. 2.1.2. Short Range Radars - Necessary to detect other vehicles or obstacles in closer proximity to the vehicle. Necessary to have them on the sides and rear of the vehicle to implement lane assist, detect vehicles to the right, left or rear of the vehicle, to detect obstacles such as vehicles, pedestrians or objects when driving in reverse, and to detect when a vehicle is approaching too close to the rear of the vehicle. 2.1.3. Cameras - Needed for rear view assistance when driving in reverse, driver monitoring to ensure a driver is available and ready to take over the vehicle when transitioning between CACC++ and manual control, and even for blind spot visibility. Satellite cameras can also be used to give an aerial overview of the vehicle\\'s position on the road. 2.1.4. Actuator Controls - Used to handle the actual functionality of CACC++ from an operating standpoint. Actuators would be responsible for breaking when approaching a vehicle or obstacle in front of or behind the vehicle, changing the trajectory of the vehicle on curves or to implement lane assist, and to accelerate the vehicle to keep the appropriate speed when on slopes or when needed. 2.1.5. Internal Sensors - Allow the system to know specific statuses of internal parts of the vehicle. There are many sensors already present in cars, but the sensors that are pertinent to CACC++ would be sensors that monitor things such as wheel speed, deceleration, assisted braking, acceleration, and other internal functions. 6 Template based on IEEE Std 830-1998 for SRS.

This information will be used in conjunction with other location information to help determine targets and proper speed to maintain on a given road. 2.2. Software 2.2.1. Detect and track targets in front using radar, cameras, and GPS, and determine if they are moving or fixed. 2.2.2. Communicate GPS and packet information from the vehicles in front of you to vehicles behind you using radio. 2.2.3. When following a target vehicle, always attempt to match their speed and maintain a safe following distance. 2.2.4. Ensure that the platoon travels in a coordinated and safe manner, by not travelling at unsafe speeds for the given roads, with safe spacing, and with fully functioning subsystems. 2.2.5. When an inappropriate command is given in the system, flag the issue and send it to the OEM cloud. 2.2.6. When the platoon is decelerating or stopping, allow vehicles with less braking power to begin decelerating first. 2.2.7. When the platoon is accelerating, allow vehicles with less acceleration power to accelerate first. 2.2.8. The VC must be able to collect data from a variety of sensors, controls, radars, etc. and decide what action to proceed with. 2.2.9. There must be a system of fault tolerance that prioritizes specific actions over others. The VC must decide which action is the safest within the context. 2.2.10. The VC needs to have direct control over the actuators that manage the throttle and brakes. Communication with these components must be nearly instant. 2.2.11. The VC must update a GUI in real time to provide visual feedback about the vehicle\\'s current state and surroundings, such as obstacles that need to be avoided, to the user. 2.2.12. The VC must be able to receive input from the user interface (Setting the speed of the vehicle, switching control, etc.). 2.2.13. The VC must effectively manage memory and clean up unused objects that are no longer pertinent to the function of the CACC++. 2.2.14. The VC must be able to identify whether it is in a platoon. If so, it must be able to send and receive envelopes to platoon vehicles behind them. It must also be able to continue to track targets outside of the platoon while it is in the platoon. 2.2.15. The VC must be able to receive software updates while still functioning. If it can update the system while functioning it will, if the system needing updating is safety critical, it should defer control back to the driver and update when it is safe. 7 Extends:  Cross-refs: Requirements 2.1.5, 2.2.10, 2.2.6  Use cases: 4.3 Domain Model Figure 2 below shows an object-oriented model, or domain model, for our system.

       "  'What is the system architecture or what is the architecture of the software': 'Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Project CACC++ 2 Authors: Erich Hairston, Dean Dawson, Gabrie Italia, Evan Shoup, Kaela Burger Customer: Mr. Bill Milam Instructor: Dr. Betty Cheng 1 Introduction Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control++ (CACC++) is a system which expands the current capabilities of Adaptive Cruise Control to make the system safer and easier to use. CACC++ enables a vehicle to follow a platoon with the use of sensors to detect nearby vehicles and follow safety procedures, while maintaining a constant speed and distance set by the driver. To achieve an advanced system, key points such as functionality, requirements, constraints, and dependencies highlight the importance of the necessary details in the CACC++ system. Models are included to provide more detailed interpretations, as well as a prototype that demonstrates several scenarios in which the system behaves. The CACC++ system contains subsystems that include sensors, communication, and control of the vehicle to function without the dependency of an operator. 1.1 Purpose A functional CACC++ relies on its underlying subsystems and allows the interaction between infrastructure and the vehicle with the appropriate actions to such scenarios. The purpose of the software requirements specification is to help the customer understand the team’s interpretation of the product and their approach on how to achieve a system that follows the requirements. Several diagrams are provided that describe the CACC++ system in detail and how it is used daily to provide a better understanding for the reader. A domain model is included, which maps out the main components of the system. A use case diagram is also added, which models common high level behaviors of the system. Sequence diagrams, which describe the interactions between the classes in the domain model in different scenarios are also included. And lastly, state diagrams are included which describe how components of our system move through different states and respond to outside messages. 1.2 Scope CACC++ is a system available in a vehicle that allows the driver to let the vehicle operate independently and follow traffic regulations. To achieve this goal, the CACC++ communicates with nearby vehicles, using sensor detection, and control of the actuators in the vehicle. This expands on the current capabilities of Adaptive Cruise Control with the intent to make it safer. CACC++ is an embedded system for automotive systems that provides convenience to the operator and provides opportunities for optimization as vehicles send each other signals to communicate. When CACC++ is active, the vehicle will be a part of a platoon, follow the lead vehicle and act appropriately by altering the vehicle\\'s distance and speed based on the communication with the lead vehicle. Another case is that under CACC++ the vehicle is the lead vehicle, in which case it will lead the platoon and communicate with the vehicles behind it. A vehicle will be able to join the platoon through input within the cars user interface, and sometimes the user will be prompted on possible opportunities to join a platoon. The system is intended to support acceleration/deceleration, lateral direction, security precautions, and communication within a platoon. 1.3 Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations ● VC \\u200b : Vehicle Controller, a system within the vehicle that communicates to subsystems and sends information that updates ● CACC++ \\u200b : Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control ● OEM \\u200b : Original Equipment Manufacturer ● \\u200b ITS \\u200b : Intelligent Transport Systems, an application that aims to optimize traffic efficiency and provide safer traffic management ● Target \\u200b : a vehicle or object in front of the vehicle that is being tracked ● GUI \\u200b : Graphical user interface, the screen and buttons with which the user can interact with 1.4 Organization The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

Section 2.1 contains the context of the system, as well as the constraints on our system. Section 2.2 outlines the main functionality of the system. Section 2.3 describes the average user of our system as well as their expected experience level. Section 2.4 further discusses constraints on the system. In Section 2.5, key assumptions about our system environment will be discussed. And lastly, in Section 2.6 approportioned requirements will be described. 2.1 Product Perspective The CACC++ system is a product to be used in vehicles to expand the current capabilities of Adaptive Cruise Control, with the goal to increase safety. The CACC++ system is made of many smaller subsystems which it coordinates and controls. So, while the CACC++ is an independent system within the vehicle, it still must coordinate with all other major systems within the vehicle. There are many ways in which a user will interact with the system. A user will be able to use buttons on the steering wheel or utilize a center console screen to turn the system on and off. Furthermore, they can make necessary adjustments to the preferred following speed and distance. In addition, the user will be able to use the brakes to disengage the system. Lastly, through the GUI, the user is able to receive feedback from the system. As for hardware constraints, the vehicle must have actuators installed on the throttle and the brakes for the purpose of monitoring and controlling the acceleration of the vehicle. In addition, a radar and camera must be installed at the front of the vehicle to receive information about targets. Other hardware constraints include a GPS system and a radio to communicate with other vehicles. Lastly, a vehicle controller and independent monitoring system must be present in the vehicle for the system to work. Every subsystem must have software to allow for operation and communication within the system. The vehicle controller must also have software to manage all of the subsystems, in addition to software for an independent monitoring system. There must also be software to handle communications from external sources within the radio. The last major constraint of the system is memory. As the system will be embedded on a vehicle, the size of the vehicle\\'s memory limits the system size and the amount of space available for data. This constraint in memory will subsequently affect the software constraints as well. Lastly, certain safety critical systems require a backup memory to allow for system updates to be more easily carried out during operation. 2.2 Product Functions The CACC++ system consists of many different subsystems that are utilized at different times depending on what the vehicle needs to do. These include acceleration, braking, and communication with other vehicles. The CACC++ system handles these 3  Template based on IEEE Std 830-1998 for SRS. Modifications (content and ordering of information) have been made by Betty H.C. Cheng, Michigan State University (chengb at msu.edu) subsystems using sensors, radars, and other data to control the vehicle for the user on the roadway. The product also allows the user to set a safe following distance between themselves and other vehicles. The subsystems help the CACC++ by detecting and communicating with the system so that it will take appropriate action to traffic. The driver can enable the CACC++ system to join or leave a platoon. When the vehicle is part of a platoon, it communicates with other vehicles and uses the information to update the speed and distance to be in uniform with the platoon. The driver can leave the platoon by turning off the system or exiting the lane. During typical use, the system utilizes the GPS and the radio to send GPS packets to platoon vehicles behind the vehicle. The radio is also used to receive GPS packets from platoon vehicles ahead of it. The information from the GPS is combined with data from the radar and camera to track targets, and determine if they are moving or stationary. The information on the target is then used to determine if the system must accelerate, decelerate, brake, or notify the user of any actions they must take. Other functions of the system include communication with ITS and the OEM cloud, and handling system updates. 2.3 User Characteristics The user of the system should be a licensed driver that follows all traffic laws. The user must also be able to read and interact with notifications, alerts, and different types of controls on a screen inside the vehicle. The user is also expected to choose and maintain both the safe following distance and traveling speed when using the system. Lastly, the user must be alert and ready to take control of the vehicle in case of an emergency or system malfunction. 2.4 Constraints As the system controls the acceleration of the vehicle, there are quite a few safety critical properties. Firstly, the system must be independently monitored to ensure that the commands being issued to the different parts of the system are correct. The electronic throttle control and brake by wire must also be fully functional for the system to operate, and if either are determined to be functioning incorrectly, control of the vehicle should be deferred back to the user. If the throttle control and brakes were not operating correctly, unintended acceleration or braking can occur which would put the user at risk. Another safety critical property is a working radar and camera. In certain situations the camera can be used when the radar fails, but if both the radar and camera are not working properly, then control must be deferred once again to the user. The camera and radar are responsible for determining the speed of the vehicle and classifying the target\\'s speed, location, and whether collision will occur. Any error in any of those responsibilities can put the user in danger and compromises safety. In addition, if any of the main system components such as the radar, camera, and actuators are determined to be not functioning properly, then the system should not be 4 Extends:  Cross-refs: Requirements 2.1.5, 2.2.10, 2.2.6  Use cases: 4.3 Domain Model Figure 2 below shows an object-oriented model, or domain model, for our system.

Cheng, Michigan State University (chengb at msu.edu) subsystems using sensors, radars, and other data to control the vehicle for the user on the roadway. The product also allows the user to set a safe following distance between themselves and other vehicles. The subsystems help the CACC++ by detecting and communicating with the system so that it will take appropriate action to traffic. The driver can enable the CACC++ system to join or leave a platoon. When the vehicle is part of a platoon, it communicates with other vehicles and uses the information to update the speed and distance to be in uniform with the platoon. The driver can leave the platoon by turning off the system or exiting the lane. During typical use, the system utilizes the GPS and the radio to send GPS packets to platoon vehicles behind the vehicle. The radio is also used to receive GPS packets from platoon vehicles ahead of it. The information from the GPS is combined with data from the radar and camera to track targets, and determine if they are moving or stationary. The information on the target is then used to determine if the system must accelerate, decelerate, brake, or notify the user of any actions they must take. Other functions of the system include communication with ITS and the OEM cloud, and handling system updates. 2.3 User Characteristics The user of the system should be a licensed driver that follows all traffic laws. The user must also be able to read and interact with notifications, alerts, and different types of controls on a screen inside the vehicle. The user is also expected to choose and maintain both the safe following distance and traveling speed when using the system. Lastly, the user must be alert and ready to take control of the vehicle in case of an emergency or system malfunction. 2.4 Constraints As the system controls the acceleration of the vehicle, there are quite a few safety critical properties. Firstly, the system must be independently monitored to ensure that the commands being issued to the different parts of the system are correct. The electronic throttle control and brake by wire must also be fully functional for the system to operate, and if either are determined to be functioning incorrectly, control of the vehicle should be deferred back to the user. If the throttle control and brakes were not operating correctly, unintended acceleration or braking can occur which would put the user at risk. Another safety critical property is a working radar and camera. In certain situations the camera can be used when the radar fails, but if both the radar and camera are not working properly, then control must be deferred once again to the user. The camera and radar are responsible for determining the speed of the vehicle and classifying the target\\'s speed, location, and whether collision will occur. Any error in any of those responsibilities can put the user in danger and compromises safety. In addition, if any of the main system components such as the radar, camera, and actuators are determined to be not functioning properly, then the system should not be 4  Template based on IEEE Std 830-1998 for SRS. Modifications (content and ordering of information) have been made by Betty H.C. Cheng, Michigan State University (chengb at msu.edu) allowed to start and take control of the vehicle, as if it does take control, safety will be compromised. Other constraints include signal timing. Messages from the vehicle controller to the actuators and the UI must be nearly instantaneous. If the vehicle controller must issue emergency braking commands to the brakes and the UI, a significant delay in the receipt of that message can cause a collision. For this reason, the timing of these messages must be nearly instantaneous to ensure safety. Lastly, parallel operation of the CACC++ with other systems within the vehicle is another constraint of the system. The CACC++ must not interfere with the operation of other systems in the vehicle. In addition, the vehicle controller and independent monitoring system must be able to handle contradicting messages from different systems within the vehicle and determine the correct action to take. 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies For the development of the CACC++, the vehicle is assumed to have both acceleration and braking potential, and is assumed to be functional. Additionally, it can be assumed that the previous software for cruise control works and the cooperative portion of the software is installed properly. It is assumed that the system will not operate when the vehicle is on unmarked roads. The user operates the vehicle properly and knows when the system should be in use. In addition, it is assumed that the system only operates when all the subsystems are fully functional, and that any loss in functionality is detected through independent monitoring of our system which will then notify the user and defer control back to them. 2.6 Approportioning of Requirements In the future, the CACC++ may evolve to include more security measures to keep user and vehicle data safe and allow for more over-the-air updates. 3 Specific Requirements This section contains a hierarchical list of requirements for the CACC++ system. The requirements are listed in order of importance, and are separated into global invariant, primary, and secondary requirements. The primary requirements are also separated into hardware requirements, software requirements, and security requirements. 1. Global Invariant Requirements 1.1. Prevent Injury to passengers, and ensure the system is not at fault for a collision. 1.2. Always attempt to avoid an imminent collision with a target through applying brakes, notifying the user, and ceasing acceleration. 1.3. Allow the user to regain control of the system when needed. The user should never be \"locked out\" of the system. 5 Template based on IEEE Std 830-1998 for SRS. Modifications (content and ordering of information) have been made by Betty H.C.

Ensure Safe Operation of the vehicle when the system is active by following speed limits and traffic laws. 1.6. Independent monitoring of the VC commands should always occur to ensure reliability and integrity. 1.7. Diagnose and correct system issues when they occur, to recover to an operational state, which includes returning control to the user. 1.8. The CACC++ must never operate concurrently with the manual operation by the user and must not interfere with the operation of other systems within the vehicle. 1.9. The CACC++ must be able to operate with a platoon, and if the platoon is not present then the system must operate as Adaptive Cruise Control. 2. Primary Requirements 2.1. Hardware 2.1.1. Long Range Radars - To implement adaptive cruise control and monitor possible obstacles in the way of the driver there needs to be a way to “see\" a great distance in front of the vehicle. 2.1.2. Short Range Radars - Necessary to detect other vehicles or obstacles in closer proximity to the vehicle. Necessary to have them on the sides and rear of the vehicle to implement lane assist, detect vehicles to the right, left or rear of the vehicle, to detect obstacles such as vehicles, pedestrians or objects when driving in reverse, and to detect when a vehicle is approaching too close to the rear of the vehicle. 2.1.3. Cameras - Needed for rear view assistance when driving in reverse, driver monitoring to ensure a driver is available and ready to take over the vehicle when transitioning between CACC++ and manual control, and even for blind spot visibility. Satellite cameras can also be used to give an aerial overview of the vehicle\\'s position on the road. 2.1.4. Actuator Controls - Used to handle the actual functionality of CACC++ from an operating standpoint. Actuators would be responsible for breaking when approaching a vehicle or obstacle in front of or behind the vehicle, changing the trajectory of the vehicle on curves or to implement lane assist, and to accelerate the vehicle to keep the appropriate speed when on slopes or when needed. 2.1.5. Internal Sensors - Allow the system to know specific statuses of internal parts of the vehicle. There are many sensors already present in cars, but the sensors that are pertinent to CACC++ would be sensors that monitor things such as wheel speed, deceleration, assisted braking, acceleration, and other internal functions. 6 ',\n",

Further goal decompositions use sensor data to satisfy higher level goals.  5 The BCAS is responsible for obstacle detection, collision prevention, and damage mitigation if an accident were to occur for objects residing behind a vehicle, as they may be out of view of the driver’s line-of-sight. While backup systems can be an afterthought for many new vehicles, the potential damage that may be caused by accidentally back- ing into objects or pedestrians warrants a well-designed system, making the BCAS an important part of the vehicle. As accident prevention and damage mitigation are both high-level goals of vehicles, the BCAS works speciﬁcally to prevent unintended collisions with pedestrians or objects during the reverse operation of the vehicle. As such, the BCAS operates only when the vehicle is in reverse. While the BCAS is a unique addition to a vehicle, it frequently interfaces with many other components of the vehicle. As a subsystem of the vehicle, the BCAS cannot exist independently as it relies on existing components on the vehicle. Some examples include the dashboard, the haptic feedback system, and the sound system, which are mainly used for warning the driver of an obstacle. The dashboard alerts the driver though visual cues with warning messages. The sound system warns the driver in the form of audible beeps of varying frequency, relative to the distance of the detected object or pedestrian. Finally, the haptic feedback system alerts the driver by vibrating the steering wheel. The Human Machine Interface (HMI) allows the driver to directly interact with the BCAS system and control certain aspects of it (such as cleaning the main camera or disabling the system). Finally, the BCAS uses the braking system to control the automatic braking in an attempt to prevent or mitigate damages from an accident. Warning or mitigation responses are decided by the BCAS with the BCAS controller. The controller obtains input from the system sensors and executes the corresponding response(s) or action(s). Figure 1 shows the KAOS goal model [9] for the BCAS system. In the KAOS goal model, high level system objectives are decomposed into a hierarchical arrangement of lower level sub-goals or requirements. Sub-goal deﬁnes how the parents goal can be sat- isﬁed. Goals are represented by blue parallelogram, organized hierarchically. Hexagons denote Agents of the system (i.e., sensors of the system).

If multiple re- ﬁnements are connected from multiple sub-goals to a parent goal, then it is known as a OR reﬁnement. On the other hand, AND reﬁnement are represented by the merging of two sub-goal arrows into a single circle pointing to the parent goal. Yellow sub-text for a goal represent the utility function used to evaluate the satisﬁcement (degree of  4  satisfaction from 0 to 1) of the goal. Figure 2 shows the legend for the KAOS goal model. In the KAOS goal model for the BCAS, the high level goal to be satisﬁed is preventing backup collision. The goal is decomposed into multiple functional and non-functional sub-goals. First, the BCAS provides the camera feed to the driver. Next, the BCAS will not abruptly brake unless a collision is imminent. Finally, the BCAS will detect and mitigate imminent collisions by utilizing the diﬀerent sensors in the vehicle (i.e., G3). Goal G3 is further decomposed to depict the diﬀerent situations, where the object distance varies in multiple ranges (G5-G7). G8 represents the BCAS system detecting the distance of the nearby object. Further goal decompositions use sensor data to satisfy higher level goals. Section 2 describes the BCAS in detail. First, the document summarizes the product perspective and product functions. Next, the expectations for the users of the system are described. The document then describes the constraints set on the system. Finally, the document explains the assumptions, dependencies, and approportioning of requirements. 2.1 Product Perspective  The BCAS is responsible for obstacle detection, collision prevention, and damage mitigation if an accident were to occur for objects residing behind a vehicle, as they may be out of view of the driver’s line-of-sight. While backup systems can be an afterthought for many new vehicles, the potential damage that may be caused by accidentally back- ing into objects or pedestrians warrants a well-designed system, making the BCAS an important part of the vehicle. As accident prevention and damage mitigation are both high-level goals of vehicles, the BCAS works speciﬁcally to prevent unintended collisions with pedestrians or objects during the reverse operation of the vehicle. As such, the BCAS operates only when the vehicle is in reverse. While the BCAS is a unique addition to a vehicle, it frequently interfaces with many other components of the vehicle. As a subsystem of the vehicle, the BCAS cannot exist independently as it relies on existing components on the vehicle. Some examples include the dashboard, the haptic feedback system, and the sound system, which are mainly used for warning the driver of an obstacle. The dashboard alerts the driver though visual cues with warning messages. The sound system warns the driver in the form of audible beeps of varying frequency, relative to the distance of the detected object or pedestrian. Finally, the haptic feedback system alerts the driver by vibrating the steering wheel. The Human Machine Interface (HMI) allows the driver to directly interact with the BCAS system and control certain aspects of it (such as cleaning the main camera or disabling the system). Finally, the BCAS uses the braking system to control the automatic braking in an attempt to prevent or mitigate damages from an accident. Warning or mitigation responses are decided by the BCAS with the BCAS controller. The controller obtains input from the system sensors and executes the corresponding response(s) or action(s). Figure 1 shows the KAOS goal model [9] for the BCAS system. In the KAOS goal model, high level system objectives are decomposed into a hierarchical arrangement of lower level sub-goals or requirements. Sub-goal deﬁnes how the parents goal can be sat- isﬁed.

We propose this Pedestrian Backup Assist System (PBAS) to enhance vehicle safety while backing in order to reduce serious backup collisions. Without PBAS, a driver may not see a small child behind the vehicle in the mirrors or out the windows, leading to a backup accident. Therefore, PBAS provides the driver with a video feed of the scene behind the vehicle, so he or she can better see behind the vehicle. PBAS also automatically detects pedestrians and obstacles behind the car and alerts the driver if the vehicle is close to something with aural and visual alarms, since a combination of both warning types were more effective than either one alone in studies [1, 8]. Additionally, PBAS provides similar auditory alarms outside the vehicle to alert pedestrians that the vehicle is backing, so the pedestrian has a warning that he or she should move to safety. PBAS also provides automatic mitigation if a backup collision is imminent. Instead of solely relying on the driver, who may be distracted, to brake, PBAS engages the vehicle’s braking system to slow the vehicle if a collision is likely and the driver has not taken evasive action.

In this case, the system malfunction is due to catastrophic camera failure. Both the primary and backup sets are not providing sufficient information for PBAS to detect obstacles, so detection, warning, and Mitigation do not work.

Injuries may result if the system were to be hijacked by malicious actors; therefore, including security as a focus from the beginning is important for fulfilling the goal of preventing injuries.

The rapid prototype below was developed in Unity for online interaction. This is not intended to be used as a basis for actually developing the system. Instructions for how to use the prototype are provided below, followed by walkthroughs of the prototype in sample scenarios. 5.1 How to Run Prototype Figure 12 : Prototype start screen 5.2 Sample Scenarios  The following figures show how the prototype operates when the scenarios described in 4.3 are played. In some cases, there are several figures in the sequence to show changes over time. In other cases, the behavior is captured by a single image. These scenarios and more can all be played using the link above. 5.2.1 Scenario 1: Normal, unobstructed backing  Figure 13 below shows a normal backing scenario where there are no obstructions. This is the base scenario loaded by the prototype whenever Reload is clicked. This scenario begins with Mitigation enabled, although that is not necessary for this unobstructed situation.

The driver may not have any special knowledge of the system. It is assumed that the driver knows how to drive the vehicle and will respond to the warnings displayed on the InfotainmentDisplay screen and/or the auditory warnings played over the speakers. Any messages/warnings provided to the driver by the system should be clear such that anyone who drives the vehicle can understand them without any kind of training or knowledge of the system. 2.4 Constraints  To ensure maximum safety, we define global, system invariants. Invariants must hold regardless of the environment, state of the system or other onboard system, these requirements must always hold. These requirements state that the system shall:  1. Operate in any weather condition (1.3). 2. Be active if and only if the vehicle is in reverse gear (1.8). 3. Be constrained to moving back with a speed of less than 10 mph (1.9). 4. Be activated any number of times within the 5-year warranty period (2.1.4). 5. Not be activated by any remote means (2.4.1). 13. “MISRA Safety Analysis.” MISRA , Motor Industry Software Reliability Association (MISRA), www.misra.org.uk/Activities/MISRASafetyAnalysis/tabid/92/Default.aspx.  14. “Decibel Levels.” Hearing Health Foundation. https://hearinghealthfoundation.org/decibel-levels .  15.

Also, the purpose for this document is described and a list of abbreviations and definitions is provided. 1.1 Purpose  The purpose of this document is to give a detailed description of the requirements for the “Amazing Lunch Indicator” (ALI) software. It will illustrate the purpose and complete declaration for the development of system. It will also explain system constraints, interface and interactions with other external applications. This document is primarily intended to be proposed to a customer for its approval and a reference for developing the first version of the system for the development team. 1.2 Scope  The “Amazing Lunch Indicator” is a GPS-based mobile application which helps people to find the closest restaurants based on the user’s current position and other specification like price, restaurant type, dish and more. The application should be free to download from either a mobile phone application store or similar services. In order to get a view of how to divide the requirements into different releases and what requirements should be included in which release, a prioritization of the requirements is needed. This section discusses the choice of prioritization methods and gives a suggestion of how the release plan for these requirements could look like. 4.1 Choice of prioritization method  When prioritizing the requirements the ten most important ones were picked out first. This was done with a simple “1 to 10” ranking method, with one being “not important” and ten “very important”. Based on the elicitation meetings, and the perceived ideas of what was important to the different stakeholders, a number was set for each requirement. The numbers were then summed up for each requirement and the ten with the highest score were chosen to be prioritized with the cost value approach. The results, which are red-marked, can be seen in Appendix I and as shown, it turned out to be five functional requirements and five quality requirements. These requirements were then prioritized according to the cost value approach and the results can be viewed under Appendix II.  The remaining requirements were prioritized according to the “Five-Way Priority Scheme” as shown in Appendix III. This method was chosen since it gives the different stakeholders the same importance and has an enough wide range for determining which requirement is more important than the other [3]. However, in this prioritization process, the development team was not included as a stakeholder since the different features were not considered to be as important to them as for the other stakeholders. This section contains all of the functional and quality requirements of the system. It gives a detailed description of the system and all its features. 3.1 External interface Requirements  This section provides a detailed description of all inputs into and outputs from the system. It also gives a description of the hardware, software and communication interfaces and provides basic prototypes of the user interface.  3.1.1 User interfaces A first-time user of the mobile application should see the log-in page when he/she opens the application, see Figure 2. If the user has not registered, he/she should be able to do that on the log-in page. 27 4.

The results, which are red-marked, can be seen in Appendix I and as shown, it turned out to be five functional requirements and five quality requirements. These requirements were then prioritized according to the cost value approach and the results can be viewed under Appendix II. Furthermore, the software needs both Internet and GPS connection to fetch and display results. All system information is maintained in a database, which is located on a web-server. The software also interacts with the GPS-Navigator software which is required to be an already installed application on the user’s mobile phone. By using the GPS-Navigator, users can view desired restaurants on a map and be navigated to them. The application also has the capability of representing both summary and detailed information about the restaurants. 1.3 Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations  Term Definition User Someone who interacts with the mobile phone application Admin/Administrator System administrator who is given specific permission for managing and controlling the system Restaurant Owner Someone who has a restaurant and wants his restaurant to be a part the application Web-Portal A web application which present special facilities for restaurant owner Table 1 - Definitions  2 and admin GPS Global Positioning System GPS-Navigator An installed software on mobile phone which could provide GPS connection and data, show locations on map and find paths from current position to defined destination Application Store An installed application on mobile phone which helps user to find new compatible applications with mobile phone platform and download them from Internet Stakeholder Any person who has interaction with the system who is not a developer.

Introduction  This section gives a scope description and overview of everything included in this SRS document. Also, the purpose for this document is described and a list of abbreviations and definitions is provided. 1.1 Purpose  The purpose of this document is to give a detailed description of the requirements for the “Amazing Lunch Indicator” (ALI) software. It will illustrate the purpose and complete declaration for the development of system. It will also explain system constraints, interface and interactions with other external applications. This document is primarily intended to be proposed to a customer for its approval and a reference for developing the first version of the system for the development team. 1.2 Scope The administrators also only interact with the web portal. They are managing the overall system so there is no incorrect information within it. The administrator can manage the information for each restaurant as well as the options for both the mobile application users and the restaurant owners. 2.4 Constraints  The mobile application is constrained by the system interface to the GPS navigation system within the mobile phone. Since there are multiple system and multiple GPS manufacturers, the interface will most likely not be the same for every one of them. Also, there may be a difference between what navigation features each of them provide.  The Internet connection is also a constraint for the application. Since the application fetches data from the database over the Internet, it is crucial that there is an Internet connection for the application to function. This section provides a detailed description of all inputs into and outputs from the system. It also gives a description of the hardware, software and communication interfaces and provides basic prototypes of the user interface.  3.1.1 User interfaces A first-time user of the mobile application should see the log-in page when he/she opens the application, see Figure 2. If the user has not registered, he/she should be able to do that on the log-in page.  If the user is not a first-time user, he/she should be able to see the search page directly when the application is opened, see Figure 3. Here the user chooses the type of search he/she wants to conduct. This section gives a scope description and overview of everything included in this SRS document.

       "  'What are the requirements functional non functional': 'Ferry Ticketing System – Software Requirements Specification 1. Introduction  TCI Ferry (aka Caribbean Cruisin’) operates passenger ferries (no vehicles) between the islands that make up the Turks & Caicos Islands in the Caribbean. This document outlines the high-level functionality that is desired for a new Ticketing System for TCI Ferry. The system will consist of a centralized database, along with several Ticketing terminals in various locations. Connectivity between terminals and the database server will be via the internet. We anticipate having a full time “live connection” at each location, and we do not anticipate the need for “batch” processing. 1.1 Functionality Overview  - Sell tickets for trips on specific dates and times Changes to Seating and Cargo capacities are fairly straightforward, but cannot exceed the vessel’s maximums. In addition, such changes will take into account any tickets sold/reserved for the Leg, and prevent the lowering of capacities below these numbers. Switching Vessels : If there is a need to switch vessels for a Leg, the manager will use the Storm function and the Add Leg functions as described in sections 4.2.3 and 4.2.4. These changes are recorded in the Leg database table.  Cancel  Save Ferry Ticketing System – Software Requirements Specification This will allow the manager to “Storm” a Leg that would normally result from the Standard Schedule. This function will be used in the event a scheduled Leg cannot sail as scheduled. This could be due to poor weather, or mechanical failure, or any other reason. The decision to “storm a Leg” can be made at any moment prior to the vessel departing, even if all passengers have already boarded. The manager selects a specific Leg (using a radio button) in the Leg Status screen, then clicks the Storm Leg button. After confirming this choice, the system will mark the status of this Leg as “Storm”. This Leg will still appear in the Leg Status screen, but will be identified by colour and/or message. This Leg will no longer be visible in the Ticketing screen except as is required to move a ticket from this leg to another. A record will be created/updated in the Leg database table to indicate the Leg has been stormed. Note: This function will prevent any further tickets from being sold on this leg. Tickets already sold will not be cancelled, and any user can move a purchased ticket from this leg to another without penalty to the passenger. In other words, a ticket on a “stormed” leg can be exchanged at full value for another ticket, even after the scheduled sailing date. When “storming” a Leg, the system will simply mark the affected tickets as “Standby”, meaning that they are no longer associated with any Leg (i.e. no reservation). These passengers now have the option of boarding any Leg (matching the ticket Route) as a standby passenger, OR they can go to the ticketing office to get a reservation for any future Leg with seating capacity. Depending on policy, tickets may be refunded in full. When storming a Leg, the manager may need to Add one (or more) new legs to accommodate the displaced passengers. This would occur in the event the Storm function was used to deal with a mechanical failure.  4.2.4 Add a New Leg  This will allow the manager to add a completely new Leg that is not defined in the standard Schedule. This may be used to: 4.2.3 Storm a Leg  This will allow the manager to “Storm” a Leg that would normally result from the Standard Schedule.

This Leg will still appear in the Leg Status screen, but its Status will be Cancelled and it will be highlighted in Red. A cancelled Leg will no longer be visible in the Ticketing screen. A record will be created/updated in the Leg database table to indicate the Leg has been cancelled. Note: This function will only be possible if no tickets (passenger or cargo) have been sold or reserved for the Leg.  4.2.3 Storm a Leg  This will allow the manager to “Storm” a Leg that would normally result from the Standard Schedule.

The next step is to specify the days of the week that the run will occur, using check boxes. If the user selects a Vessel and Time that already exists in the standard schedule, a message will be displayed stating: “ This Run is already defined. Would you like to edit this run, or Add New? Edit/Add New ”. If user selects Edit , see section 3.2.2. Clicking Add New will present the existing Run details, with the Day check boxes grayed out (disabled) for the days that the Run is already defined. This could be used to create a Run with unique characteristics on specific Days (special Fares, Seating or Cargo capacities etc). Uniqueness of Runs: The system will consider a Run to be unique if the combination of Time/Vessel/Day is unique. This will prevent duplicate Runs from being created, but would allow a second Vessel to be scheduled if desired (e.g 6:30am/TCI Ferry/Wed and 6:30am/Daze/Wed).  3.2.2 Editing a Run  User will select a Run in the Route’s Run listing (using a radio button) and click the User will select a Run in the Route’s Run listing (using a radio button) and click the Edit Run button.
